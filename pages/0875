<p>[This Article is received in this Church, so far as it declares the Book<br/>of Homilies to be an explication of Christian doctrine, and instructive<br/>in piety and morals.

And therefore<br/>whosoever are consecrated or ordered according to the Rites of that<br/>Book, since the second year of the forenamed King Edwand unto this time,<br/>or hereafter shall be consecrated or ordered according to the same<br/>Rites; we decree all such to be rightly, orderly, and lawfully<br/>consecrated and ordered."</i></p>
<h1>XXXVII.  Of the Power of the Civil Magistrates.</h1>
<p>The Power of the Civil Magistrate extendeth to all men, as well Clergy<br/>as Laity, in all things temporal; but hath no authority in things purely<br/>spiritual.  And we hold it to be the duty of all men who are professors<br/>of the Gospel, to pay respectful obedience to the Civil Authority,<br/>regularly and legitimately constituted.</p>
