<p>whose name is Holy, "I dwell in the high and holy place, with<br/>him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the<br/>spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite<br/>ones."  <i><a href="bible:Isaiah+57%3A15">Isaiah 57:15</a></i></p>
<p>*The following Confession of Sin may then be said; or the Office may<br/>continue at once with "O Lord, open thou our lips."</p>
<h1>Confession of Sin</h1>
<p><i>The Officiant says to the people</i></p>
<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of<br/>Almighty God our heavenly Father, to render thanks for the<br/>great benefits that we have received at his hands, to set forth<br/>his most worthy praise, to hear this holy Word, and to ask, for<br/>ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are<br/>necessary for our life and our salvation.  And so that we may<br/>prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us<br/>kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts<br/>confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his<br/>infinite goodness and mercy.</p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>Let us humbly confess our sins unto Almighty God.</p>
<p><i>Silence may be kept.</i></p>
<p><i>Officiant and People together, all kneeling</i></p>
<p>Almighty and most merciful Father,<br/>we have erred and strayed from thy ways like lost sheep,<br/>we have followed too much the devices and desires of our<br/>  own hearts,<br/>we have offended against thy holy laws,<br/>we have left undone those things which we ought to<br/>  have done,</p>
