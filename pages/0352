<p>If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the<br/>truth is not in us.  But if we confess our sins, God, who is<br/>faithful and just, will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all<br/>unrighteousness.  <i><a href="bible:1+John+1%3A8%2C9">1 John 1:8,9</a></i></p>
<p>Since we have a great high priest who has pased through the<br/>heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us with confidence draw<br/>near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and<br/>find grace to help in time of need.   <i><a href="bible:Hebrews+4%3A14%2C16">Hebrews 4:14,16</a></i></p>
<p><i>The Deacon or Celebrant then says</i></p>
<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.</p>
<p><i>Silence may be kept.</i></p>
<p><i>Minister and People</i></p>
<p>Most merciful God,we confess that we have sinned against you<br/>in thought, word, and deed,<br/>by what we have done,<br/>and by what we have left undone.<br/>We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br/>we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br/>We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br/>For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br/>have mercy on us and forgive us;<br/>that we may delight in your will,<br/>and walk in your ways,<br/>to the glory of your Name.  Amen.</p>
