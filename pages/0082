<h1>Venite</h1>  <i><a href="bible:Psalm+95%3A1-7">Psalm 95:1-7</a></i>
<p>Come let us sing to the Lord; *<br/> let us shout for joy to the Rock of our salvation.</p>
<p>Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving *<br/> and raise a loud shout to him with psalms.</p>
<p>For the Lord is a great God, *<br/> and a great King above all gods.</p>
<p>In his hand are the caverns of the earth, *<br/> and the heights of the hills are his also.</p>
<p>The sea is his, for he made it, *<br/> and his hands have molded the dry land.</p>
<p>Come, let us bow down, and bend the knee, *<br/> and kneel before the Lord our Maker.</p>
<p>For he is our God,<br/>and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. *<br/> Oh, that today you would hearken to his voice!</p>
