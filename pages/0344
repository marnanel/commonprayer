<p>Through Christ let us continually offer to God the sacrifice of<br/>praise, that is, the fruit of lips that acknowledge his Name.<br/>But to do good and to distribute, forget not; for with such<br/>sacrifices God is well pleased.  <i><a href="bible:Hebrews+13%3A15%2C16">Hebrews 13:15,16</a></i></p>
<p>Worthy art thou, O Lord our God, to receive glory and honor<br/>and power; for thou hast created all things, and by thy will<br/>they were created and have their being.  <i><a href="bible:Revelation+4%3A11">Revelation 4:11</a></i></p>
<p>Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory,<br/>and the victory, and the majesty.  For all that is in the heaven<br/>and in the earth is thine.  Thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and<br/>thou art exalted as head above all.  <i><a href="bible:1+Chronicles+29%3A11">1 Chronicles 29:11</a></i></p>
<p><i>or this bidding</i></p>
<p>Let us with gladness present the offerings and oblations of<br/>our life and labor to the Lord.</p>
