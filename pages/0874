<h1>XXX.  Of both Kinds.</h1>
<p>The Cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the Lay-people: for both the<br/>parts of the Lord's Sacrament, by Christ's ordinance and commandment,<br/>ought to be ministered to all Christian men alike.</p>
<h1>XXXI.  Of the one Oblation of Christ finished upon the Cross.</h1>
<p>The Offering of Christ once made in that perfect redemption,<br/>propitiation, and satisfaction, for all the sins of the whole world,<br/>both original and actual; and there is none other satisfaction for sin,<br/>but that alone.  Wherefore the sacrifices of Masses, in the which it was<br/>commonly said, that the Priest did offer Christ for the quick and the<br/>dead, to have remission of pain or guilt, were blasphemous fables, and<br/>dangerous deceits.</p>
<h1>XXXII.  Of the Marriage of Priests.</h1>
<p>Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, are not commanded by God's Law, either to<br/>vow the estate of single life, or to abstain from marriage: therefore it<br/>is lawful for them, as for all other Christian men, to marry at their<br/>own discretion, as they shall judge the same to serve better to<br/>godliness.</p>
<h1>XXXIII.  Of excommunicate Persons, how they are to be avoided.</h1>
<p>That person which by open denunciation of the Church is rightly cut off<br/>from the unity of the Church, and excommunicated, ought to be taken of<br/>the whole multitude of the faithful, as an Heathen and Publican, until<br/>he be openly reconciled by penance, and received into the Church by a<br/>Judge that hath the authority thereunto.</p>
<h1>XXXIV.  Of the Traditions of the Church.</h1>
<p>It is not necessary that the Traditions and Ceremonies be in all places<br/>one, or utterly like; for at all times they have been divers, and may be<br/>changed according to the diversity of countries, times, and men's<br/>manners, so that nothing be ordained against God's Word.  Whosoever,<br/>through his private judgment, willingly and purposely, doth openly break<br/>the Traditions and Ceremonies of the Church, which be not repugnant to<br/>the Word of God, and be ordained and approved by common authority, ought<br/>to be rebuked openly, (that others may fear to do the like,) as he that<br/>offendeth against the common order of the Church, and hurteth the<br/>authority of the Magistrate, and woundeth the consciences of the weak<br/>brethren.</p>
<p>Every particular or national Church hath authority to ordain, change,<br/>and abolish, Ceremonies or Rites of the Church ordained only by man's<br/>authority, so that all things be done to edifying.</p>
<h1>XXXV.  Of the Homilies.</h1>
<p>The Second Book of Homilies, the several titles whereof we have joined<br/>under this Article, doth contain a godly and wholesome Doctrine, and<br/>necessary for these times, as doth the former Book of Homilies, which<br/>were set forth in the time of Edward the Sixth; and therefore we judge<br/>them to be read in Churches by the Ministers, diligently and distinctly,<br/>that they may be understanded of the people.</p>
