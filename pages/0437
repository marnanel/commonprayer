<p><i>If Banns are to be published, the following form is used</i></p>
<p>I publish the Banns of Marriage between <b><span class="person">N</span></b> <b><span class="person">N</span></b>. of __________ and <b><span class="person">N</span></b> <b><span class="person">N</span></b>.<br/>of __________.  If any of you know just cause why they may not be joined<br/>together in Holy Matrimony, you are bidden to declare it.  This is the<br/>first (<i>or</i> second, <i>or</i> third) time of asking.</p>
<p><i>The Celebration and Blessing of a Marriage may be used with any<br/>authorized liturgy for the Holy Eucharist.  This service then replaces<br/>the Ministry of the Word, and the Eucharist begins with the Offertory.</i></p>
<p><i>After the Declaration of Consent, if there is to be a giving in<br/>marriage, or presentation, the Celebrant asks</i></p>
<p>Who gives (presents) this woman to be married to this man?</p>
<p><i>or the following</i></p>
<p>Who presents this woman and this man to be married to each other?</p>
<p><i>To either question, the appropriate answer is, "I do."  If more than<br/>one person responds, they do so together.</i></p>
<p><i>For the Ministry of the Word it is fitting that the man and woman to be<br/>married remain where they may conveniently hear the reading of<br/>Scripture.  They may approach the Altar, either for the exchange of<br/>vows, or for the Blessing of the Marriage.</i></p>
<p><i>It is appropriate that all remain standing until the conclusion of the<br/>Collect.  Seating may be provided for the wedding party, so that all may<br/>be seated for the Lessons and the homily.</i></p>
<p><i>The Apostles' Creed may be recited after the Lessons, or after the<br/>homily, if there is one.</i></p>
<p><i>When desired, some other suitable symbol of the vows may be used in<br/>place of the ring.</i></p>
