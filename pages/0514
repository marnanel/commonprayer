<p>Brothers and sisters in Christ Jesus, you have heard testimony<br/>given that <b><span class="person">N</span></b><b><span class="person">N</span></b> has been duly and lawfully elected to be a<br/>bishop of the Church of God to serve in the Diocese of <b><span class="person">N</span></b><br/>You have been assured of <i>his</i> suitability and that the Church<br/>has approved him for this sacred responsibility.  Nevertheless,<br/>if any of you know any reason why we should not proceed,<br/>let it now be made known.</p>
<p><i>If no objections are made, the Presiding Bishop continues</i></p>
<p>Is it your will that we ordain <b><span class="person">N</span></b> a bishop?</p>
<p><i>The People respond in these or other words</i></p>
<p>That is our will.</p>
<p><i>Presiding Bishop</i></p>
<p>Will you uphold <b><span class="person">N</span></b> as bishop?</p>
<p><i>The People respond in these or other words</i></p>
<p>We will.</p>
<p><i>The Presiding Bishop then says</i></p>
<p>The Scriptures tell us that our Savior Christ spent the whole<br/>night in prayer before he chose and sent forth his twelve<br/>apostles.  Likewise, the apostles prayed before they appointed<br/>Matthias to be one of their number.  Let us, therefore, follow<br/>their examples, and offer our prayers to Almighty God before<br/>we ordain <b><span class="person">N</span></b> for the work to which we trust the Holy Spirit<br/>has called <i>**him</i>.</p>
