<h1>The Reconciliation<br/>of a Penitent</h1>
<h1>Form One</h1>
<p><i>The Penitent begins</i></p>
<p>Bless me, for I have sinned.</p>
<p><i>The Priest says</i></p>
<p>The Lord be in your heart and upon your lips that you may<br/>truly and humbly confess your sins: In the Name of the<br/>Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>Penitent</i></p>
<p>I confess to Almighty God, to his Church, and to you, that<br/>I have sinned by my own fault in thought, word, and deed, in<br/>things done and left undone; especially __________.  For these<br/>and all other sins which I cannot now remember, I am truly<br/>sorry.  I pray God to have mercy on me.  I firmly intend<br/>amendment of life, and I humbly beg forgiveness of God and<br/>his Church, and ask you for counsel, direction, and absolution.</p>
<p><i>Here the Priest may offer counsel, direction, and comfort.</i></p>
