<p>Now that <b><span class="person">N</span></b> and <b><span class="person">N</span></b> have given themselves to each other by<br/>solemn vows, with the joining of hands and the giving and<br/>receiving of a ring, I pronounce that they are husband<br/>and wife, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and<br/>of the Holy Spirit.</p>
