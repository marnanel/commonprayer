<p>Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and<br/>Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever<br/>sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:</p>
<p><i>Celebrant and People</i></p>
<p>Holy, Holy, Holy Lord, God of power and might,<br/>heaven and earth are full of your glory.<br/>  Hosanna in the highest.<br/>Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.<br/>  Hosanna in the highest.</p>
<p><i>The people stand or kneel.</i></p>
<p><i>Then the Celebrant continues</i></p>
<p>Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us<br/>for yourself, and, when we had fallen into sin and become<br/>subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus<br/>Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human<br/>nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the<br/>God and Father of all.</p>
<p>He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself,<br/>in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole<br/>world.</p>
<p><i>At the following words concerning the bread, the Celebrant is to hold<br/>it, or to lay a hand upon it; and at the words concerning the cup, to<br/>hold or place a hand upon the cup and any other vessel containing wine<br/>to be consecrated.</i></p>
<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our<br/>Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks<br/>to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, "Take,<br/>eat: This is my Body, which is given for you.  Do this for the<br/>remembrance of me."</p>
