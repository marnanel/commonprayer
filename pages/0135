<p>Lord, you now have set your servant free *<br/> to go in peace as you have promised;</p>
<p>For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *<br/> whom you have prepared for all the world to see:</p>
<p>A Light to enlighten the nations, *<br/> and the glory of your people Israel.</p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br/> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.</p>
<p>Guide us waking, O Lord, and guard us sleeping; that awake<br/>we may watch with Christ, and asleep we may rest in peace.</p>
