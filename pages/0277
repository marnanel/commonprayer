<p>Dear People of God: Our heavenly Father sent his Son into<br/>the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world<br/>through him might be saved; that all who believe in him<br/>might be delivered from the power of sin and death, and<br/>become heirs with him of everlasting life.</p>
<p>We pray, therefore, for people everywhere according to their<br/>needs.</p>
