<h1>XXVI.  Of the Unworthiness of the Ministers, which hinders not the<br/>effect of the Sacraments.</h1>
<p>Although in the visible Church the evil be ever mingled with the good,<br/>and sometimes the evil have chief authority in the Ministration of the<br/>Word and Sacraments, yet forasmuch as they do not the same in their own<br/>name, but in Christ's, and do minister by his commission and authority,<br/>we may use their Ministry, both in hearing the Word of God, and in<br/>receiving the Sacraments.  Neither is the effect of Christ's ordinance<br/>taken away by their wickedness, nor the grace of God's gifts diminished<br/>from such as by faith, and rightly, do receive the Sacraments ministered<br/>unto them; which be effectual, because of Christ's institution and<br/>promise, although they be ministered by evil men.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it appertaineth to the discipline of the Church, that<br/>inquiry be made of evil Ministers, and that they be accused by those<br/>that have knowledge of their offences; and finally, being found guilty,<br/>by just judgment be deposed.</p>
<h1>XVII.  Of Baptism</h1>
<p>Baptism is not only a sign of profession, and mark of difference,<br/>whereby Christian men are discerned from others that be not christened,<br/>but it is also a sign of Regeneration or New-Birth, whereby, as by an<br/>instrument, they that receive Baptism rightly are grafted into the<br/>Church; the promises of the forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to<br/>be the sons of God by the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed;<br/>Faith is confirmed, and Grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.</p>
<p>The Baptism of young Children is in any wise to be retained in the<br/>Church, as most agreeable with the institution of Christ.</p>
<h1>XVIII.  Of the Lord's Supper.</h1>
<p>The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of the love that Christians<br/>ought to have among themselves one to another; but rather it is a<br/>Sacrament of our Redemption by Christ's death: insomuch that to such as<br/>rightly, worthily, and with faith, receive the same, the Bread which we<br/>break is a partaking of the Body of Christ; and likewise the Cup of<br/>Blessing is a partaking of the Blood of Christ.</p>
<p>Transubstantiation (or the change of the substance of Bread and Wine) in<br/>the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant<br/>to the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament,<br/>and hath given occasion to many superstitions.</p>
<p>The Body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten, in the Supper, only after<br/>an heavenly and spiritual manner.  And the mean whereby the Body of<br/>Christ is received and eaten in the Supper, is Faith.</p>
<p>The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was not by Christ's ordinance<br/>reserved, carried about, lifted up, or worshipped.</p>
<h1>XXIX.  Of the Wicked, which eat not the Body of Christ in the use of<br/>the Lord's Supper.</h1>
<p>The Wicked, and such as be void of a lively faith, although they<br/>docarnally and visibly press with their teeth (as Saint Augustine saith)<br/>the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ; yet in no wise are they<br/>partakers of Christ: but rather, to their condemnation, do eat and drink<br/>the sign or Sacrament of so great a thing.</p>
