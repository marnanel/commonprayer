<h1>The Great Vigil of Easter</h1>
<h1>The Lighting of the Paschal Candle</h1>
<p><i>In the darkness, fire is kindled; after which the Celebrant may address<br/>the people in these or similar words</i></p>
<p>Dear friends in Christ: On this most holy night, in which our<br/>Lord Jesus passed over from death to life, the Church invites<br/>her members, dispersed throughout the world, to gather in<br/>vigil and prayer.  For this is the Passover of the Lord, in which,<br/>by hearing his Word and celebrating his Sacraments, we share<br/>in his victory over death.</p>
<p><i>The Celebrant may say the following prayer</i></p>
<p>Let us pray.</p>
<p>O God, through your Son you have bestowed upon your<br/>people the brightness of your light: Sanctify this new fire, and<br/>grant that in this Paschal feast we may so burn with heavenly<br/>desires, that with pure minds we may attain to the festival of<br/>everlasting light; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>The Paschal Candle is then lighted from the newly kindled fire, and the<br/>Deacon (the Celebrant if there is no deacon) bearing the Candle, leads<br/>the procession to the chancel, pausing three times and singing or<br/>saying</i></p>
<p>The light of Christ.</p>
<p><i>People</i> Thanks be to God.</p>
