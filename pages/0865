<p>So the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God.</p>
<p>And yet they are not three Gods, but one God.</p>
<p>So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, and the Holy Ghost Lord.</p>
<p>And yet not three Lords, but one Lord.</p>
<p>For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge<br/>every Person by himself to be both God and Lord,</p>
<p>So are we forbidden by the Catholic Religion, to say, There be three<br/>Gods, or three Lords.</p>
<p>The Father is made of none, neither created, nor begotten.</p>
<p>The Son is of the Father alone, not made, nor created, but begotten.</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost is of the Father and of the Son, neither made, nor<br/>created, nor begotten, but proceeding.</p>
<p>So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons;  one<br/>Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts.</p>
<p>And in this Trinity none is afore, or after other; none is greater, or<br/>less than another;</p>
<p>But the whole three Persons are co-eternal together and co-equal.</p>
<p>So that in all things, as is aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity and the<br/>Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped.</p>
<p>He therefore that will be saved must thus think of the Trinity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation that he also<br/>believe rightly the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>For the right Faith is, that we believe and confess, that our Lord<br/>Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man;</p>
<p>God, of the substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds; and<br/>Man of the substance of his Mother, born in the world;</p>
<p>Perfect God and perfect Man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh<br/>subsisting.</p>
<p>Equal to the Father, as touching his Godhead; and inferior to the<br/>Father, as touching his manhood;</p>
<p>Who, although he be God and Man, yet he is not two, but one Christ;</p>
<p>One, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh but by taking of the<br/>Manhood into God;</p>
<p>One altogether; not by confusion of Substance, but by unity of  Person.</p>
<p>For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man, so God and Man is one<br/>Christ;</p>
<p>Who suffered for our salvation, descended into hell, rose again the<br/>third day from the dead.</p>
<p>He ascended into heaven, he sitteth at the right hand of the Father,<br/>God Almighty, from whence he will come to judge the quick and the  dead.</p>
<p>At whose coming all men will rise again with their bodies and shall<br/>give account for their own works.</p>
<p>And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting; and they<br/>that have done evil into everlasting fire.</p>
<p>This is the Catholic Faith, which except a man believe faithfully, he<br/>cannot be saved.</p>
