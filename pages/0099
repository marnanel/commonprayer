<p><i>A Collect for Fridays</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, whose most dear Son went not up to joy but<br/>first he suffered pain, and entered not into glory before he<br/>was crucified:  Mercifully grant that we, walking in the way<br/>of the cross, may find it none other than the way of life and<br/>peace; through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>A Collect for Saturdays</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, who after the creation of the world rested<br/>from all you works and sanctified a day of rest for all your<br/>creatures:  Grant that we, putting away all earthly anxieties,<br/>may be duly prepared for the service of your sanctuary, and<br/>that our rest here upon earth may be a preparation for the<br/>eternal rest promised to your people in heaven; through Jesus<br/>Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>A Collect for the Renewal of Life</i></p>
<p>O God, the King eternal, whose light divides the day from the<br/>night and turns the shadow of death into the morning:  Drive<br/>far from us all wrong desires, incline our hearts to keep your<br/>law, and guide our feet into the way of peace; that, having<br/>done your will with cheerfulness during the day, we may,<br/>when night comes, rejoice to give you thanks; through Jesus<br/>Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>A Collect for Peace</i></p>
<p>O God, the author of peace and lover of concord, to know<br/>you is eternal life and to serve you is perfect freedom:  Defend<br/>us, your humble servants, in all assaults of our enemies; that<br/>we, surely trusting in your defense, may not fear the power of<br/>any adversaries; through the might of Jesus Christ our Lord,<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>
