<p>Lord God Almighty, in whose Name the founders of this<br/>country won liberty for themselves and for us, and lit the<br/>torch of freedom for nations then unborn:  Grant that we and<br/>all the people of this land may have grace to maintain our<br/>liberties in righteousness and peace; through Jesus Christ our<br/>Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one<br/>God, for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<h1>Saint Mary Magdalene</h1>  <i>July 22</i>
<p>Almighty God, whose blessed Son restored Mary Magdalene<br/>to health of body and of mind, and called her to be a witness<br/>of his resurrection:  Mercifully grant that by your grace we<br/>may be healed from all our infirmities and know you in the<br/>power of his unending life; who with you and the Holy Spirit<br/>lives and reigns, one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<h1>Saint James</h1>  <i>July 25</i>
<p>O gracious God, we remember before you today your servant<br/>and apostle James, first among the Twelve to suffer martyrdom<br/>for the Name of Jesus Christ; and we pray that you will pour<br/>out upon the leaders of your Church that spirit of self-denying<br/>service by which alone they may have true authority among<br/>your people; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and<br/>reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for<br/>ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
