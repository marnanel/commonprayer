<h1>A Thanksgiving for the Birth<br/>or Adoption of a Child</h1>
<p><i>As soon as convenient after the birth of a child, or after receiving a<br/>child by adoption, the parents, with other members of the family, should<br/>come to the church to be welcomed by the congregation and to give thanks<br/>to Almighty God.  It is desirable that this take place at a Sunday<br/>service.  In the Eucharist it may follow the Prayers of the People<br/>preceding the Offertory.  At Morning or Evening Prayer it may take place<br/>before the close of the Office.</i></p>
<p><i>When desired, a briefer form of this service may be used, especially in<br/>the hospital or at home; in which case the Celebrant may begin with the<br/>Act of Thanksgiving, or with the prayer "O God, you have taught is."  A<br/>passage from Scripture may first be read.  Either <a href="bible:Luke+2%3A41-51">Luke 2:41-51</a>, or Luke<br/>18:15-17, is appropriate.</i></p>
<p><i>During the prayers, some parents may wish to express thanks in their<br/>own words.</i></p>
<p><i>At the proper time, the Celebrant invites the parents and other members<br/>of the family to present themselves before the Altar.</i></p>
