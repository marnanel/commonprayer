<p><i>The Presiding Bishop and other Bishops now lay their hands upon the<br/>head of the bishop-elect, and say together</i></p>
<p>Therefore, Father, make <b><span class="person">N</span></b> a bishop in your Church.  Pour<br/>out upon him the power of your princely Spirit, whom you<br/>bestowed upon your beloved Son Jesus Christ, with whom he<br/>endowed the apostles, and by whom your Church is built up in<br/>every place, to the glory and unceasing praise of your Name.</p>
<p><i>The Presiding Bishop continues</i></p>
<p>To you, O Father, all hearts are open; fill, we pray, the heart<br/>of this your servant whom you have chosen to be a bishop in<br/>your Church, with such love of you and of all the people, that<br/><i>he</i> may feed and tend the flock of Christ, and exercise<br/>without reproach the high priesthood to which you have<br/>called <i>him</i>, serving before you day and night in the ministry<br/>of reconciliation, declaring pardon in your Name, offering the<br/>holy gifts, and wisely overseeing the life and work of the Church.  In<br/>all things may <i>he</i> present before you the acceptable offering of a<br/>pure, and gentle, and holy life; through Jesus Christ your Son, to whom,<br/>with you and the Holy Spirit, be honor and power and glory in the<br/>Church, now and for ever.</p>
<p><i>The People in a loud voice respond</i>    Amen.</p>
<p><i>The new bishop is now vested according to the order of bishops.</i></p>
<p><i>A Bible is presented with these words</i></p>
<p>Receive the Holy Scriptures.  Feed the flock of Christ<br/>committed to your charge, guard and defend them in his<br/>truth, and be a faithful steward of his holy Word and<br/>Sacraments.</p>
<p><i>After this other symbols of office may be given.</i></p>
