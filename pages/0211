<h1>First Sunday of Advent</h1>
<p>Almighty God, give us grace to cast away the works of<br/>darkness, and put on the armor of light, now in the time of<br/>this mortal life in which your Son Jesus Christ came to visit<br/>us in great humility; that in the last day, when he shall come<br/>again in his glorious majesty to judge both the living and the<br/>dead, we may rise to the life immortal; through him who lives<br/>and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and<br/>for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<h1>Second Sunday of Advent</h1>
<p>Merciful God, who sent your messengers the prophets to<br/>preach repentance and prepare the way for our salvation:<br/>Give us grace to heed their warnings and forsake our sins,<br/>that we may greet with joy the coming of Jesus Christ our<br/>Redeemer; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy<br/>Spirit, one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
