<h1>Fifth Sunday in Lent</h1>
<p>Almighty God, you alone can bring into order the unruly<br/>wills and affections of sinners:  Grant your people grace to<br/>love what you command and desire what you promise; that,<br/>among the swift and varied changes of the world, our hearts<br/>may surely there be fixed where true joys are to be found;<br/>through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with<br/>you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p>Almighty and everliving God, in your tender love for the<br/>human race you sent your Son our Savior Jesus Christ to<br/>take upon him our nature, and to suffer death upon the cross,<br/>giving us the example of his great humility:  Mercifully grant<br/>that we may walk in the way of his suffering, and also share<br/>in his resurrection; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives<br/>and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever<br/>and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
