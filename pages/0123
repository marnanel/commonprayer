<p><i>A Collect for Sundays</i></p>
<p>O God, you make us glad with the weekly remembrance of<br/>the glorious resurrection of you Son our Lord:  Give us this<br/>day such blessing through our worship of you, that the week<br/>to come may be spent in your favor; through Jesus Christ our<br/>Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>A Collect for Fridays</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, whose most dear Son went not up to joy but<br/>first he suffered pain, and entered not into glory before he<br/>was crucified:  Mercifully grant that we, walking in the way<br/>of the cross, may find it none other than the way of life and<br/>peace; through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>A Collect for Saturdays</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, who after the creation of the world rested<br/>from all you works and sanctified a day of rest for all your<br/>creatures:  Grant that we, putting away all earthly anxieties,<br/>may be duly prepared for the service of your sanctuary, and<br/>that our rest here upon earth may be a preparation for the<br/>eternal rest promised to your people in heaven; through Jesus<br/>Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>A Collect for Peace</i></p>
<p>O God, the author of peace and lover of concord, to know<br/>you is eternal life and to serve you is perfect freedom:  Defend<br/>us, your humble servants, in all assaults of our enemies; that<br/>we, surely trusting in your defense, may not fear the power of<br/>any adversaries; through the might of Jesus Christ our Lord,<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>A Collect for Aid against Perils</i></p>
<p>Be our light in the darkness, O Lord, and in your great mercy<br/>defend us from all perils and dangers of this night; for the love<br/>of your only Son, our Savior Jesus Christ.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
