<h1>An Order for Burial</h1>
<p><i>When, for pastoral considerations, neither of the burial rites in this<br/>Book is deemed appropriate, the following form is used.</i></p>
<p>1.  The body is received.  The celebrant may meet the body and conduct<br/>it into the church or chapel, or it may be in place before the<br/>congregation assembles.</p>
<p>2.  Anthems from Holy Scripture or psalms may be sung or said, or a<br/>hymn may be sung.</p>
<p>3.  Prayer may be offered for the bereaved.</p>
<p>4.  One or more passages of Holy Scripture are read.  Psalms, hymns,<br/>or anthems may follow the readings.  If there is to be a Communion, the<br/>last Reading is from the Gospel.</p>
<p>5.  A homily may follow the Readings, and the Apostles' Creed may be<br/>recited.</p>
<p>6.  Prayer, including the Lord's Prayer, is offered for the deceased,<br/>for those who mourn, and for the Christian community, remembering the<br/>promises of God in Christ about eternal life.</p>
<p>7.  The deceased is commended to God, and the body is committed to its<br/>resting place.  The committal may take place either where the preceding<br/>service has been held, or at the graveside.</p>
<p>8.  If there is a Communion, it precedes the commendation, and begins<br/>with the Peace and Offertory of the Eucharist.  Any of the authorized<br/>eucharistic prayers may be used.</p>
