<h1><a href="bible:Psalm+130">Psalm 130</a></h1>  <i>De profundis</i>
<p>Out of the deep have I called unto thee, O LORD; *<br/> Lord, hear my voice.</p>
<p>O let thine ears consider well *<br/> the voice of my complaint.</p>
<p>If thou, LORD, wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss, *<br/> O Lord, who may abide it?</p>
<p>Fore there is mercy with thee, *<br/> therefore shalt thou be feared.</p>
<p>I look for the LORD; my soul doth wait for him; *<br/> in his word is my trust.</p>
<p>My soul fleeth unto the Lord before the morning watch; *<br/> I say, before the morning watch.</p>
<p>O Israel, trust in the LORD,<br/>for with the LORD there is mercy, *<br/> and with him is plenteous redemption.</p>
<p>And he shall redeem Israel *<br/> from all his sins.</p>
<h1><a href="bible:Psalm+139">Psalm 139</a></h1>  <i>Domine, probasti</i>
<p>O LORD, thou hast searched me out, and known me. *<br/> Thou knowest my down-sitting and mine up-rising;<br/> thou understandest my thoughts long before.</p>
<p>Thou art about my path, and about my bed, *<br/> and art acquainted with all my ways.</p>
<p>For lo, there is not a word in my tongue, *<br/> but thou, O LORD, knowest it altogether.</p>
