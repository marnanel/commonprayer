<h1>Of a Saint</h1>
<p>Almighty God, you have surrounded us with a great cloud of<br/>witnesses:  Grant that we, encouraged by the good example of<br/>your servant <b><span class="person">N</span></b>, may persevere in running the race that is set<br/>before us, until at last we may with <i>him</i> attain to your eternal<br/>joy; through Jesus Christ, the pioneer and perfecter of our<br/>faith, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one<br/>God, for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>O God, you have brought us near to an innumerable company<br/>of angels, and to the spirits of just men made perfect:  Grant us<br/>during our earthly pilgrimage to abide in their fellowship, and<br/>in our heavenly country to become partakers of their joy;<br/>through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you<br/>and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, by your Holy Spirit you have made us one with<br/>your saints in heaven and on earth:  Grant that in our earthly<br/>pilgrimage we may always be supported by this fellowship of<br/>love and prayer, and know ourselves to be surrounded by their<br/>witness to your power and mercy.  We ask this for the sake of<br/>Jesus Christ, in whom all our intercessions are acceptable<br/>through the Spirit, and who lives and reigns for ever and ever.<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>
