<p>Almighty God, you have given your only-begotten Son to<br/>take our nature upon him, and to be born [this day] of a pure<br/>virgin:  Grant that we, who have been born again and made<br/>your children by adoption and grace, may daily be renewed<br/>by your Holy Spirit; through our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom<br/>with you and the same Spirit be honor and glory, now and<br/>for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
