<p><i>When the Litany is sung or said immediately before the Eucharist, the<br/>Litany concludes here, and the Eucharist begins with the Salutation and<br/>the Collect of the Day.</i></p>
<p><i>On all other occasions, the Officiant and People say together</i></p>
<p>Our Father, who art in heaven,<br/> hallowed be thy Name,<br/> thy kingdom come,<br/> thy will be done,<br/> on earth as it is in heaven.</p>
<p>Give us this day our daily bread.<br/>And forgive us our trespasses,<br/> as we forgive those<br/> who trespass against us.</p>
<p>And lead us not into temptation,<br/> but deliver us from evil.</p>
<p>For thine is the kingdom,<br/> and the power, and the glory,<br/> for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>
<p><b><span class="person">V</span></b>  O Lord, let thy mercy be showed upon us;</p>

<p><i>The Officiant concludes with the following or some other Collect</i></p>
<p>Let us pray.</p>
<p>Almighty God, who hast promised to hear the petitions of<br/>those who ask in thy Son's Name: We beseech thee mercifully<br/>to incline thine ear to us who have now made our prayers<br/>and supplications unto thee; and grant that those things<br/>which we have asked faithfully according to thy will, may be<br/>obtained effectually, to the relief of our necessity, and to the<br/>setting forth of thy glory; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <i>Amen.</i></p>
