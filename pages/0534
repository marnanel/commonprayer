<p>May <i>he</i> exalt you, O Lord, in the midst of your people; offer<br/>spiritual sacrifices acceptable to you; boldly proclaim the<br/>gospel of salvation; and rightly administer the sacraments of<br/>the New Covenant. Make <i>him</i> a faithful pastor, a patient<br/>teacher, and a wise councilor. Grant that in all things <i>he</i> may<br/>serve without reproach, so that your people may be<br/>strengthened and your Name glorified in all the world. All<br/>this we ask through Jesus Christ our Lord, who with you and<br/>the Holy Spirit lives and reigns, one God, for ever and ever.</p>
<p><i>The People in a loud voice respond</i>    Amen.</p>

<p><i>The Bishop then gives a Bible to the newly ordained, saying</i></p>
<p>Receive this Bible as a sign of the authority given you to<br/>preach the Word of God and to administer his holy<br/>Sacraments.  Do not forget the trust committed to you as a<br/>priest of the Church of God.</p>
<p><i>The Bishop greets the newly ordained.</i></p>
<h1>The Peace</h1>
<p><i>The new Priest then says to the congregation</i></p>
<p>The peace of the Lord be always with you.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  And also with you.</p>
<p><i>The Presbyters present greet the newly ordained; who then greets family<br/>members and others, as may be convenient.  The Clergy and People greet<br/>one another.</i></p>
