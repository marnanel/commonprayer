<p><i>The Celebrant now praises God for the salvation of the world through<br/>Jesus Christ our Lord.</i></p>
<p><i>The Prayer continues with these words</i></p>
<p>And so, Father, we bring you these gifts.  Sanctify them by<br/>your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood<br/>of Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p><i>At the following words concerning the bread, the Celebrant is to hold<br/>it, or to lay a hand upon it; and at the words concerning the cup, to<br/>hold or place a hand upon the cup and any other vessel containing wine<br/>to be consecrated.</i></p>
<p>On the night he was betrayed he took bread, said the<br/>blessing, and gave it to his friends, and<br/>said, "Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you.<br/>Do this for the remembrance of me."</p>
<p>After supper, he took the cup of wine, gave thanks, and<br/>said, "Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new<br/>Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the<br/>forgiveness of sins.  Whenever you drink it, do this for the<br/>remembrance of me."</p>
<p>Father, we now celebrate the memorial of your Son.  By<br/>means of this holy bread and cup, we show forth the sacrifice<br/>of his death, and proclaims his resurrection, until he comes<br/>again.</p>
<p>Gather us by this Holy Communion into one body in your<br/>Son Jesus Christ.  Make us a living sacrifice of praise.</p>
<p>By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy<br/>Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and<br/>for ever.  AMEN.</p>
