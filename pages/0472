<p>God is in the midst of her,<br/>therefore shall she not be removed; *<br/> God shall help her, and that right early.</p>
<p>Be still then, and know that I am God; *<br/> I will be exalted among the nations,<br/> and I will be exalted in the earth.</p>
<p>The LORD of hosts is with us; *<br/> the God of Jacob is our refuge.</p>
<h1><a href="bible:Psalm+90">Psalm 90</a></h1>  <i>Domino, refugium</i>
<p>LORD, thou hast been our refuge, *<br/> from one generation to another.</p>
<p>Before the mountains were brought forth,<br/>or ever the earth and the world were made, *<br/> thou art God from everlasting, and the world without end.</p>
<p>Thou turnest man to destruction; *<br/> again thou sayest, Come again, ye children of men.</p>
<p>For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday<br/>  when it is past, *<br/> and as a watch in the night.</p>
<p>As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep, *<br/> and fade away suddenly like the grass.</p>
<p>In the morning it is green, and groweth up; *<br/> but in the evening it is cut down, dried up, and withered.</p>
<p>For we consume away in thy displeasure, *<br/> and are afraid at thy wrathful indignation.</p>
<p>Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee, *<br/> and our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.</p>
