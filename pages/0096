<p>You, Christ, are the king of glory,<br/>the eternal Son of the Father.<br/>When you became man to set us free<br/>you did not shun the Virgin's womb.<br/>You overcame the sting of death<br/>and opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers.<br/>You are seated at God's right hand in glory.<br/>We believe that you will come and be our judge.<br/> Come then, Lord, and help your people,<br/> bought with the price of your own blood,<br/> and bring us with your saints<br/> to glory everlasting.</p>
<h1>The Apostles' Creed</h1>
<p><i>Officiant and People together, all standing</i></p>
<p>I believe in God, the Father almighty,<br/> creator of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>I believe in Jesus Christ, his only son, our Lord.<br/> He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit<br/>  and born of the Virgin Mary.<br/> He suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br/>  was crucified, died, and was buried.<br/> He descended to the dead.<br/> On the third day he rose again.<br/> He ascended into heaven,<br/>  and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br/> He will come again to judge the living and the dead.</p>
<p>I believe in the Holy Spirit,<br/> the holy catholic Church,<br/> the communion of saints,<br/> the forgiveness of sins,<br/> the resurrection of the body,<br/> and the life everlasting.  Amen.</p>
