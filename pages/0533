<h1>The Consecration of the Priest</h1>
<p><i>All now stand except the ordinand, who kneels facing the Bishop and the<br/>presbyters who stand to the right and left of the Bishop.</i></p>
<p><i>The hymn, Veni Creator Spiritus, or the hymn, Veni Sancte Spiritus, is<br/>sung.</i></p>
<p><i>A period of silent prayer follows, the people still standing.</i></p>
<p><i>The Bishop then says this Prayer of Consecration</i></p>
<p>God and Father of all, we praise you for your infinite love in<br/>calling us to be a holy people in the kingdom of your Son<br/>Jesus our Lord, who is the image of your eternal and invisible<br/>glory, the firstborn among many brethren, and the head of<br/>the Church.  We thank you that by his death he has overcome<br/>death, and, having ascended into heaven, has poured his gifts<br/>abundantly upon your people, making some apostles, some<br/>prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, to<br/>equip the saints for the work of ministry and the building up<br/>of his body.</p>
<p><i>Here the Bishop says hands upon the head of the ordinand, the Priests<br/>who are present also laying on their hands.  At the same time the Bishop<br/>prays</i></p>
<p>Therefore, Father, through Jesus Christ your Son, give<br/>your Holy Spirit to <b><span class="person">N</span></b>; fill <i>him</i> with grace and power, and<br/>make <i>him</i> a priest in your Church.</p>
