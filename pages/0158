<h1>Concerning the Proper<br/>of the Church Year</h1>
<p>The proper of the Church Year includes the appointed Collects, the<br/>Proper Prefaces, directions for which are to be found in the pages<br/>following; and the appointed Psalms and Lessons, which appear in tables<br/>beginning on page <a href="889.html">889</a>.</p>
<p>The Proper appointed for the Sunday is also used at celebrations of the<br/>Eucharist on the weekdays following, unless otherwise ordered for Holy<br/>Days and Various Occasions.</p>
<p>The Proper to be used on each of the Sundays after Pentecost (except for<br/>Trinity Sunday) is determined by the calendar date of that Sunday.  Thus,<br/>in any year, the Proper for the Sunday after Trinity Sunday (the Second<br/>Sunday after Pentecost) is the numbered Proper (number 3 through<br/>number 8), the calendar date of which falls on that Sunday, or is closest<br/>to it, whether before or after.  Thereafter, the Propers are used<br/>consecutively.  For example, if the Sunday after Trinity Sunday is May 26,<br/>the sequence begins with Proper 3 (Propers 1 and 2 being used on the<br/>weekdays of Pentecost and Trinity weeks).  If the Sunday after Trinity<br/>Sunday is June 13, the sequence begins with Proper 6 (Propers 1 through<br/>3 being omitted that year, and Propers 4 and 5 being used in Pentecost<br/>and Trinity weeks).  See also the Table on pages <a href="884.html">884</a>-<a href="885.html">885</a>.</p>
<p>The Collect appointed for any Sunday or other Feast may be used at the<br/>evening service of the day before.</p>
<p>Directions concerning the Common of Saints and services for Various<br/>Occasions are on pages 195, 199, 246 and 251.</p>
