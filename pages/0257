<p>you for all members of you holy Church, that in their vocation<br/>and ministry they may truly and devoutly serve you; through<br/>our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with<br/>you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>Preface of Baptism, or of the Season</i></p>
<h1>16. For the Mission of the Church</h1>
<p>O God, you have made of one blood all the peoples of the<br/>earth, and sent your blessed Son to preach peace to those<br/>who are far off and to those who are near:  Grant that people<br/>everywhere may seek after you and find you, bring the nations<br/>into your fold, pour out your Spirit upon all flesh, and hasten<br/>the coming of your kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br/>who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God,<br/>now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>O God of all the nations of the earth:  Remember the<br/>multitudes who have been created in your image but have not<br/>known the redeeming work of our Savior Jesus Christ; and<br/>grant that, by the prayers and labors of your holy Church,<br/>they may be brought to know and worship you as you have<br/>been revealed in your Son; who lives and reigns with you and<br/>the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
