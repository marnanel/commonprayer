From Easter Day through the Day of<br/>Pentecost, the Paschal Candle, if used, should be burning in its<br/>customary place before the people assemble; the officiant then goes to a<br/>place close by it to begin the service by its light.</i></p>
<p><i>The Short Lessons may be read from any version of the Scriptures<br/>authorized for public worship in this Church, and should be read without<br/>announcement or conclusion.  When one or more Scripture Lessons are to<br/>be read later in the service, the Short Lesson may be omitted.</i></p>
<p><i>For the lighting of the candles at the Altar and elsewhere, in Easter<br/>Season the flame may be taken from the Paschal Candle.  At other times,<br/>the candle or candles carried in at the beginning of the service may be<br/>placed on or near the Altar, and other candles may be lighted from them.<br/>During Advent, the lighting of an Advent Wreath may take place after<br/>the Prayer for Light.  On special occasions, lighted candles may be<br/>distributed to members of the congregation.</i></p>
<p><i>When this service is used in private houses, candles may be lighted at<br/>the dining table, or at some other convenient place.</i></p>
<p><i>If incense is to be used, it is appropriate after the candles have been<br/>lighted and while the hymn Phos hilaron is being sung.</i></p>

When desired, more than one Lesson may be read, with<br/>silence or singing between them.</i></p>
<p><i>If an additional hymn is desired, it may be sung immediately before the<br/>Blessing or Dismissal.</i></p>
<p><i>When a meal is to follow, a blessing over food may serve as the<br/>conclusion of this form of service.</i></p>
