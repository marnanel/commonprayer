<h1><a href="bible:Psalm+4">Psalm 4</a></h1>  <i>Cum invocarem</i>
<p>1  Answer me when I call, O God, defender of my cause; *<br/> you set me free when I am hard-pressed;<br/> have mercy on me and hear my prayer.</p>
<p>2  "You mortals, how long will you dishonor my glory; *<br/> how long will you worship dumb idols<br/> and run after false gods?"</p>
<p>3  Know that the LORD does wonders for the faithful; *<br/> when I call upon the LORD, he will hear me.</p>
<p>4  Tremble, then, and do not sin; *<br/> speak to your heart in silence upon your bead.</p>
<p>5  Offer the appointed sacrifices *<br/> and put your trust in the LORD.</p>
