<p><i>All stand.  The Presiding Bishop then says</i></p>
<p><b><span class="person">N</span></b>, through these promises you have committed yourself to<br/>God, to serve his Church in the office of bishop.  We therefore<br/>call upon you, chosen to be a guardian of the Church's faith,<br/>to lead us in confessing that faith.</p>
<p><i>Bishop-elect</i></p>
<p>We believe in one God.</p>
<p><i>Then all sing or say together</i></p>
<p>We believe in one God,<br/>  the Father, the Almighty,<br/>  maker of heaven and earth,<br/>  of all that is, seen and unseen.</p>
<p>We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,<br/>  the only Son of God,<br/>  eternally begotten of the Father,<br/>  God from God, Light from Light,<br/>  true God from true God,<br/>  begotten, not made,<br/>  of one Being with the Father.<br/>  Through him all things were made.<br/>  For us and for our salvation<br/>    he came down from heaven:<br/>  by the power of the Holy Spirit<br/>    he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,<br/>    and was made man.<br/>  For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br/>  he suffered death and was buried.<br/>  On the third day he rose again<br/>      in accordance with the Scriptures;<br/>    he ascended into heaven<br/>      and is seated at the right hand of the Father.</p>
