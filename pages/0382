<p>Commemoration of the Dead</p>
<p>Through Jesus Christ our Lord; who rose victorious from the<br/>dead, and comforts us with the blessed hope of everlasting<br/>life.  For to your faithful people, O Lord, life is changed, not<br/>ended; and when our mortal body lies in death, there is<br/>prepared for us a dwelling place eternal in the heavens.</p>
