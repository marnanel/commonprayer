<p>Almighty God, we thank you that by the death and<br/>resurrection of your Son Jesus Christ you have overcome sin<br/>and brought us to yourself, and that by the sealing<br/>of your Holy Spirit you have bound us to your service.  Renew in<br/><i>these</i> your <i>servants</i> the covenant you have made with <i>them</i> at<br/>  <i>their</i><br/>Baptism.  Send <i>them</i> forth in the power of that Spirit to<br/>perform the service you set before <i>them</i>; through Jesus Christ<br/>your Son our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the<br/>Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
