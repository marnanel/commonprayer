<p>O God, whose days are without end, and whose mercies<br/>cannot be numbered: Make us, we pray, deeply aware of the<br/>shortness and uncertainty of human life; and let your Holy<br/>Spirit lead us in holiness and righteousness all our days; that,<br/>when we shall have served you in our generation, we may be<br/>gathered to our ancestors, having the testimony of a good<br/>conscience, in the communion of the Catholic Church, in the<br/>confidence of a certain faith, in the comfort of a religious and<br/>holy hope, in favor with you, our God, and in perfect charity<br/>with the world.  All this we ask through Jesus Christ<br/>our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>O God, the King of saints, we praise and glorify your holy<br/>Name for all your servants who have finished their course in<br/>your faith and fear: for the blessed Virgin Mary; for the holy<br/>patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs; and for all your<br/>other righteous servants, known to us and unknown; and we<br/>pray that, encouraged by their examples, aided by their<br/>prayers, and strengthened by their fellowship, we also may<br/>be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light; through<br/>the merits of your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, by your death you took away thy sting of<br/>death:  Grant to us your servants so to follow in faith where<br/>you have led the way, that we may at length fall asleep<br/>peacefully in you ad wake up in your likeness; for your<br/>tender mercies' sake.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>Father of all, we pray to you for those we love, but see no<br/>longer: Grant them your peace; let light perpetual shine upon<br/>them; and, in your loving wisdom and almighty power, work<br/>in them the good purpose of your perfect will; through Jesus<br/>Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
