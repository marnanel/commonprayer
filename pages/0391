<p>For this <i>congregation</i> [for those who are present, and for<br/>those who are absent], that we may be delivered from<br/>hardness of heart, and show forth your glory in all that we<br/>do, we pray to you, O Lord.</p>
<p>[[For our enemies and those who wish us harm, and for all<br/>whom we have  injured or offended, we pray to you, O Lord.]]</p>
<p>[[For ourselves; for the forgiveness of our sins, and for the<br/>grace of  the Holy Spirit to amend our lives, we pray to you, O<br/>Lord.]]</p>
<p>For all who have commended themselves to our prayers; for<br/>our families, friends, and neighbors; that being freed from<br/>anxiety, they may live in joy, peace, and health, we pray to<br/>you, O Lord.</p>
<p>[[For __________, we pray to you, O Lord.]]</p>
<p>For all who have died in the communion of your Church, and<br/>those whose faith is known to you alone, that, with all the<br/>saints, they may have rest in that place where there is no pain<br/>or grief, but life eternal, we pray to you, O Lord.</p>
<p>Rejoicing in the fellowship of [the ever-blessed Virgin Mary, (<i>blessed<br/><b><span class="person">N</span></b></i>) and] all the saints, let us commend ourselves, and one another,<br/>and all our life to Christ our God.<br/><i>To you, O Lord our God.</i></p>
