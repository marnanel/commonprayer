<p><i>All stand.  The Bishop says to the people</i></p>
<p>Dear friends in Christ, you know the importance of this<br/>ministry, and the weight of your responsibility in presenting<br/><b><span class="person">N</span></b><b><span class="person">N</span></b> for ordination to the sacred priesthood.  Therefore if<br/>any of you know any impediment or crime because of which<br/>we should not proceed, come forward now, and make it known.</p>
<p><i>If no objection is made, the Bishop continues</i></p>
<p>Is it your will that <b><span class="person">N</span></b> be ordained a priest?</p>
<p><i>The People respond in these or other words</i></p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i></p>
<p>Will you uphold him in this ministry?</p>
<p><i>The People respond in these or other words</i></p>
<p>We will.</p>
<p><i>The Bishop then calls the people to prayer with these or similar words</i></p>
<p>In peace let us pray to the Lord.</p>
<p><i>All kneel, and the Person appointed leads the Litany for Ordinations,<br/>or some other approved litany.  At the end of the litany, after the<br/>Kyries, the Bishop stands and reads the Collect for the Day, or the<br/>following Collect, or both, first saying</i></p>
<p>The Lord be with you</p>
<p><i>People</i>  And also with you.</p>
