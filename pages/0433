<h1>The Blessing<br/>of a Civil Marriage</h1>
<p><i>The Rite begins as prescribed for celebrations of the Holy Eucharist,<br/>using the Collect and Lessons appointed in the Marriage service.</i></p>
<p><i>After the Gospel (and homily), the husband and wife stand before the<br/>Celebrant, who addresses them in these or similar words</i></p>
<p><b><span class="person">N</span></b> and <b><span class="person">N</span></b>, you have come here today to seek the blessing of<br/>God and of his Church upon your marriage.  I require,<br/>therefore, that you promise, with the help of God, to fulfill<br/>the obligations which Christian Marriage demands.</p>
<p><i>The Celebrant then addresses the husband, saying</i></p>
<p><b><span class="person">N</span></b>, you have taken <b><span class="person">N</span></b> to be your wife.  Do you promise to<br/>love her, comfort her, honor and keep her, in sickness and in<br/>health; and, forsaking all others, to be faithful to her as long<br/>as you both shall live?</p>
<p><i>The Husband answers</i>  I do.</p>
<p><i>The Celebrant then addresses the wife, saying</i></p>
<p><b><span class="person">N</span></b>, you have taken <b><span class="person">N</span></b> to be your husband.  Do you promise<br/>to love him, comfort him, honor and keep him, in sickness<br/>and in health; and, forsaking all others, to be faithful to him<br/>as long as you both shall live?</p>
<p><i>The Wife answers</i>  I do.</p>
