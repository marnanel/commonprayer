<p>And yours by right, O Lamb that was slain, *<br/> for with your blood you have redeemed for God,</p>
<p>From every family, language, people, and nation, *<br/> a kingdom of priests to serve our God.</p>
<p>And so, to him who sits upon the throne, *<br/> and to Christ the Lamb,</p>
<p>Be worship and praise, dominion and splendor, *<br/> for ever and for evermore.</p>

<p><i><a href="bible:Revelation+15%3A3-4">Revelation 15:3-4</a></i></p>
<p>O ruler of the universe, Lord God,<br/>great deeds are they that you have done, *<br/> surpassing human understanding.</p>
<p>Your ways are ways of righteousness and truth, *<br/> O King of all the ages.</p>
<p>Who can fail to do you homage, Lord,<br/>and sing the praises of your Name? *<br/> for you only are the Holy One.</p>
<p>All nations will draw near and fall down before you, *<br/> because your just and holy works have been revealed.</p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br/> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.</p>
