<h1>A Form of Commitment<br/>to Christian Service</h1>
<p><i>This form may be used when a person wishes to make or renew a<br/>commitment to the service of Christ in the world, either in general<br/>terms, or upon undertaking some special responsibility.</i></p>
<p><i>It is essential that the person seeking to make or renew a commitment<br/>prepare in advance, in consultation with the celebrant, the Act of<br/>Commitment, which may be in the form either of a statement of intention<br/>or of a series of questions and answers, but which should include a<br/>reaffirmation of baptismal promises.</i></p>
<p><i>Before the Offertory of the Eucharist, the person comes forward at the<br/>invitation of the celebrant, and, standing before the congregation,<br/>makes the Act of Commitment.</i></p>
<p><i>After this, the Celebrant says these or similar words</i></p>
<p>May the Holy Spirit guide and strengthen you, that in this,<br/>and in all things, you may do God's will in the service<br/>of the kingdom of his Christ.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>In the name of this congregation I commend you to this<br/>work, and pledge you our prayers, encouragement, and<br/>support.</p>
