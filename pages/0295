<p>Almighty God, who for our redemption gave your only-<br/>begotten Son to the death of the cross, and by his glorious<br/>resurrection delivered us from the power of our enemy:  Grant<br/>us so to die daily to sin, that we may evermore live with him<br/>in the joy of his resurrection; through Jesus Christ your Son<br/>our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,<br/>one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>O God, who made this most holy night to shine with the<br/>glory of the Lord's resurrection: Stir up in your Church that<br/>Spirit of adoption which is given to us in Baptism, that we,<br/>being renewed both in body and mind, may worship you<br/>in sincerity and truth; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives<br/>and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God,<br/>now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
