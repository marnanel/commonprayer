<h1>Daily Devotions for<br/>Families and Individuals</h1>
<p><i>These devotions follow the basic structure of the Daily Office of the<br/>Church.</i></p>
<p><i>When more than one person is present, the Reading and the Collect<br/>should be read by one person, and the other parts said in unison, or in<br/>some other convenient manner.  (For suggestions about reading the<br/>Psalms, see page <a href="582.html">582</a>.)</i></p>
<p><i>For convenience, appropriate Psalms, Readings, and Collects are<br/>provided in each service.  When desired, however, the Collect of the<br/>Day, or any of the Collects appointed in the Daily Offices, may be used<br/>instead.</i></p>
<p><i>The Psalms and Readings may be replaced by those appointed in</i></p>
<p><i>a) the Lectionary for Sundays, Holy Days, the Common of Saints, and<br/>Various Occasions, page <a href="888.html">888</a>.</i></p>
<p><i>b) the Daily Office Lectionary, page <a href="934.html">934</a></i></p>
<p><i>c) some other manual of devotion which provides daily selections for<br/>the<br/>Church Year.</i></p>
