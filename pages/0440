<h1>For the Birth of a Child</h1>
<p><i>The Celebrant addresses the congregation in these or similar words</i></p>
<p>Dear Friends:  The birth of a child is a joyous and solemn<br/>occasion in the life of a family.  It is also an occasion for<br/>rejoicing in the Christian community.  I bid you, therefore,<br/>to join <b><span class="person">N</span></b> [and <b><span class="person">N</span></b>] in giving thanks to Almighty God our<br/>heavenly Father, the Lord of all life, for the gift of <b><span class="person">N</span></b> to be<br/>their son (daughter) [and with <b><span class="person">N</span></b> (and <b><span class="person">N</span></b> <b><span class="person">N</span></b>.), for a new<br/>brother (sister)].  Let us say together:</p>
<p><i>The service continues with the Magnificat or one of the Psalms on pages<br/>441-443.</i></p>
<h1>For an Adoption</h1>

<p>Dear Friends:  It has pleased God our heavenly Father to<br/>answer the earnest prayers of <b><span class="person">N</span></b> [and <b><span class="person">N</span></b>], member(s) of this<br/>Christian family, for the gift of a child.  I bid you join with<br/><i>them</i> [and with <b><span class="person">N</span></b> (and <b><span class="person">N</span></b> <b><span class="person">N</span></b>.), who now <i>has</i> a new brother<br/>(sister)] in offering heartfelt thanks for the joyful and solemn<br/>responsibility which is <i>theirs</i> by the coming of <b><span class="person">N</span></b> to be a<br/>member of their family.  But first, our friends wish us, here<br/>assembled, to witness the inauguration of this new<br/>relationship.</p>
<p>The Celebrant asks the parent or parents</p>
<p><b><span class="person">N</span></b> [and <b><span class="person">N</span></b>], do you take this child for your own?</p>
<p><i>Parent(s)</i>  I do.</p>
