<p><i>Silence</i></p>
<p>Merciful God, Creater of all the peoples of the earth and<br/>lover of souls: Have compassion on all who do not know you<br/>as you are revealed in your Son Jesus Christ; let your Gospel<br/>be preached with grace and power to those who have not<br/>heard it; turn the hearts of those who resist it; and bring<br/>home to your fold those who have gone astray; that there<br/>may be one flock under one shepherd, Jesus Christ our Lord.<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>Let us commit ourselves to God, and pray for the grace<br/>of a holy life, that, with all who have departed this world and<br/>have died in the peace of Christ, and those whose faith is<br/>known to God alone, we may be accounted worthy to enter<br/>into the fullness of the joy of our Lord, and receive the crown<br/>of life in the day of resurrection.</p>
<p><i>Silence</i></p>
<p>O God of unchangeable power and eternal light: Look<br/>favorably on your whole Church, that wonderful and sacred<br/>mystery; by the effectual working of your providence, carry<br/>out in tranquility the plan of salvation; let the whole<br/>world see and know that things which were cast down are being<br/>raised up, and things which had grown old are being made<br/>new, and that all things are being brought to their perfection<br/>by him through whom all things were made, your Son Jesus<br/>Christ our Lord; who lives and reigns with you, in the unity<br/>of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>The service may be concluded here with the singing of a hymn or anthem,<br/>the Lord's Prayer, and the final prayer on page <a href="282.html">282</a>.</i></p>
