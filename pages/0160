<h1>Fourth Sunday of Advent</h1>
<p>We beseech thee, Almighty God, to purify our consciences by<br/>thy daily visitation, that when thy Son Jesus Christ cometh he<br/>may find in us a mansion prepared for himself; through the<br/>same Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with<br/>thee, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, now and for ever. <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p>O God, who makest us glad by the yearly remembrance of<br/>the birth of thy only Son Jesus Christ:  Grant that as we joyfully<br/>receive him for our Redeemer, so we may with sure<br/>confidence behold him when he shall come to be our Judge;<br/>who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost, one<br/>God, world without end.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
