<h1>At the Celebration of the Eucharist</h1>
<p><i>The liturgy continues with the Offertory.  Deacons prepare the Table.</i></p>
<p><i>Standing at the Lord's Table, with the Bishop and other presbyters, the<br/>newly ordained Priest joins in the celebration of the Holy Eucharist and<br/>in the Breaking of the Bread.</i></p>
<p>After Communion</p>
<p><i>In place of the usual postcommunion prayer, the following is said</i></p>
<p>Almighty Father, we thank you for feeding us with the holy<br/>food of the Body and Blood of your Son, and for uniting us<br/>through him in the fellowship of your Holy Spirit.  We thank<br/>you for raising up among us faithful servants for the ministry<br/>of your Word and Sacraments.  We pray that <b><span class="person">N</span></b> may be to us<br/>an effective example in word and action, in love and patience,<br/>and in holiness of life.  Grant that we, with <i>him</i>, may serve<br/>you now, and always rejoice in your glory; through Jesus<br/>Christ your Son our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and<br/>the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>The Bishop then asks the new priest to bless the people.</i></p>
<p><i>The new Priest says</i></p>
<p>The blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,<br/>be among you, and remain with you always.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>A Deacon, or a Priest if no deacon is present, dismisses the people</i></p>
<p>Let us go forth into the world, rejoicing in the<br/>power of the Spirit.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  Thanks be to God.</p>
<p><i>From Easter Day through the Day of Pentecost, "Alleluia, alleluia," may<br/>be added to the dismissal and to the response.</i></p>
