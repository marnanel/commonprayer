<h1>The Holy Eucharist:  Rite One</h1>
<h1>The Word of God</h1>
<p><i>A hymn, psalm, or anthem may be sung.</i></p>
<p><i>The people standing, the Celebrant may say</i></p>
<p>Blessed be God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  And blessed be his kingdom, now and for ever.<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>In place of the above, from Easter Day through the Day of Pentecost</i></p>
<p><i>Celebrant</i>  Alleluia.  Christ is risen.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  The Lord is risen indeed.  Alleluia.</p>
<p><i>In Lent and on other penitential occasions</i></p>
<p><i>Celebrant</i>  Bless the Lord who forgiveth all our sins;</p>
<p><i>People</i>  His mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p><i>The Celebrant says</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, unto whom all hearts are open, all desires<br/>known, and from whom no secrets are hid:  Cleanse the<br/>thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of thy Holy Spirit,<br/>that we may perfectly love thee, and worthily magnify thy<br/>holy Name; through Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
