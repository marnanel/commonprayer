<p>6  Many are saying,<br/>"Oh, that we might see better times!" *<br/> Lift up the light of your countenance upon us, O LORD.</p>
<p>7  You have put gladness in my heart, *<br/> more than when grain and wine and oil increase.</p>
<p>8  I lie down in peace; at once I fall asleep; *<br/> for only you, LORD, make me dwell in safety.</p>
<h1><a href="bible:Psalm+31">Psalm 31</a></h1>  <i>In te, Domine, speravi</i>
<p>1  In you, O LORD, have I taken refuge;<br/>let me never be put to shame: *<br/> deliver me in your righteousness.</p>
<p>2  Incline your ear to me; *<br/> make haste to deliver me.</p>
<p>3  Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe,<br/>for you are my crag and my stronghold; *<br/> for the sake of your Name, lead me and guide me.</p>
<p>4  Take me out of the net that they have secretly set for me, *<br/> for you are my tower of strength.</p>
<p>5  Into your hands I commend my spirit, *<br/> for you have redeemed me,<br/> O LORD, O God of truth.</p>
<h1><a href="bible:Psalm+91">Psalm 91</a></h1> <i>Qui habitat</i>
<p>1  He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High *<br/> abides under the shadow of the Almighty.</p>
<p>2  He shall say to the LORD,<br/>"You are my refuge and my stronghold, *<br/> my God in whom I put my trust."</p>
