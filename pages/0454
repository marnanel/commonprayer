<p><i>Or else the following general confession may be said</i></p>
<p>Most merciful God,<br/>we confess that we have sinned against you<br/>in thought, word, and deed,<br/>by what we have done,<br/>and by what we have left undone.<br/>We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br/>we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves. We are truly sorry and we<br/>humbly repent.</p>
