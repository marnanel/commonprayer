<h1>XI.  Of the Justification of Man.</h1>
<p>We are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord<br/>and Saviour Jesus Christ by Faith, and not for our own works or<br/>deservings.  Wherefore, that we are justified by Faith only, is a most<br/>wholesome Doctrine, and very full of comfort, as more largely expressed<br/>in the Homily of Justification.</p>
<h1>XII.  Of Good Works.</h1>
<p>Albeit that Good Works, which are the fruits of Faith, and follow after<br/>Justification, cannot put away our sins, and endure the severity of<br/>God's judgment; yet are they pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ,<br/>and do spring out necessarily of a true and lively Faith; insomuch that<br/>by them a lively Faith may be as evidently known as a tree discerned by<br/>the fruit.</p>
<h1>XIII.  Of Works before Justification.</h1>
<p>Works done before the grace of Christ, and the Inspiration of the<br/>Spirit, are not pleasant to God, forasmuch as they spring not of faith<br/>in Jesus Christ; neither do they make men meet to receive grace, or (as<br/>the School-authors say) deserve grace of congruity: yea rather, for that<br/>they are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done, we<br/>doubt not but they have the nature of sin.</p>
<h1>XIV.  Of Works of Supererogation.</h1>
<p>Voluntary Works besides, over and above, God's Commandments, which they<br/>call Works of Supererogation, cannot be taught without arrogancy and<br/>impiety: for by them men do declare, that they not only render unto God<br/>as much as they are bound to, but that they do more for his sake, than<br/>of bounden duty is required: whereas Christ saith plainly, When ye have<br/>done all that are commanded to you, say, We are unprofitable servants.</p>
<h1>XV.  Of Christ alone without Sin.</h1>
<p>Christ in the truth of our nature was made like unto us in all things,<br/>sin only except, from which he was clearly void, both in his flesh, and<br/>in his spirit.  He came to be the Lamb without spot, who, by sacrifice<br/>of himself once made, should take away the sins of the world; and sin<br/>(as Saint John saith) was not in him.  But all we the rest, although<br/>baptized, and born again in Christ, yet offend in many things; and if we<br/>say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.</p>
<h1>XVI.  Of Sin after Baptism.</h1>
<p>Not every deadly sin willingly committed after Baptism is sin against<br/>the Holy Ghost, and unpardonable.  Wherefore the grant of repentance is<br/>not be denied to such as fall into sin after Baptism.  After we have<br/>received the Holy Ghost, we may depart from grace given, and fall into<br/>sin, and by the grace of God we may arise again, and amend our lives.<br/>And therefore they are to be condemned, which say, they can no more sin<br/>as long as they live here, or deny the place of forgiveness to such as<br/>truly repent.</p>
