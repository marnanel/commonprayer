<p>O Lord our God, accept the fervent prayers of your people; in<br/>the multitude of your mercies, look with compassion upon us<br/>and all who turn to you for help; for you are gracious, O<br/>lover of souls, and to you we give glory, Father, Son, and<br/>Holy Spirit, now and for ever. <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p>Lord Jesus Christ, you said to your apostles, "Peace I give<br/>to you; my own peace I leave with you:" Regard not our sins,<br/>but the faith of your Church, and give to us the peace and<br/>unity of that heavenly City, where with the Father and the<br/>Holy Spirit you live and reign, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<h1>7</h1>
<p>Hasten, O Father, the coming of <i>thy</i> kingdom; and grant that<br/>we <i>thy</i> servants, who now live by faith, may with joy behold<br/><i>thy</i> Son at his coming in glorious majesty; even Jesus Christ,<br/>our only Mediator and Advocate.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p>Almighty God, by your Holy Spirit you have made us one<br/>with your saints in heaven and on earth: Grant that in our<br/>earthly pilgrimage we may always be supported by this<br/>fellowship of love and prayer, and know ourselves to be<br/>surrounded by their witness to your power and mercy.  We<br/>ask this for the sake of Jesus Christ, in whom all our<br/>intercessions are acceptable through the Spirit, and who lives<br/>and reigns for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
