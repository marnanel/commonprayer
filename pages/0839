<p>We thank you for the great resources of this nation.  They<br/>make us rich, though we often exploit them.<br/><i>Forgive us.</i></p>
<p>We thank you for the men and women who have made this<br/>country strong.  They are models for us, though we often fall<br/>short of them.<br/><i>Inspire us.</i></p>
<p>We thank you for the torch of liberty which has been lit in<br/>this land.  It has drawn people from every nation, though we<br/>have often hidden from its light.<br/><i>Enlighten us.</i></p>
<p>We thank you for the faith we have inherited in all its rich<br/>variety.  It sustains our life, though we have been faithless<br/>again and again.<br/><i>Renew us.</i></p>
<p>Help us, O Lord, to finish the good work here begun.<br/>Strengthen our efforts to blot out ignorance and prejudice,<br/>and to abolish poverty and crime.  And hasten the day when<br/>all our people, with many voices in one united chorus, will<br/>glorify your holy Name.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>6.  For Heroic Service</i></p>
<p>O Judge of the nations, we remember before you with grateful<br/>hearts the men and women of our country who in the day of<br/>decision ventured much for the liberties we now enjoy.  Grant<br/>that we may not rest until all the people of this land share the<br/>benefits of true freedom and gladly accept its disciplines.  This<br/>we ask in the Name of Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
