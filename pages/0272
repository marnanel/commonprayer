<p>Almighty God, whose most dear Son went not up to joy but<br/>first he suffered pain, and entered not into glory before he<br/>was crucified: Mercifully grant that we, walking in the way<br/>of the cross, may find it none other than the way of life and<br/>peace; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p>Almighty and everliving God, in your tender love for the<br/>human race you sent your Son our Savior Jesus Christ to take<br/>upon him our nature, and to suffer death upon the cross,<br/>giving us the example of his great humility: Mercifully grant<br/>that we may walk in the way of his suffering, and also share<br/>in his resurrection; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives<br/>and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever<br/>and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
