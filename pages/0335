<p>And we most humbly beseech thee, O merciful Father, to<br/>hear us; and, of thy almighty goodness, vouchsafe to bless<br/>and sanctify, with thy Word and Holy Spirit, these thy gifts<br/>and creatures of bread and wine; that we, receiving them<br/>according to thy Son our Savior Jesus Christ's holy institution,<br/>in remembrance of his death and passion, may be partakers<br/>of his most blessed Body and Blood.</p>
<p>And we earnestly desire thy fatherly goodness mercifully to<br/>accept this our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving; most<br/>humbly beseeching thee to grant that, by the merits and<br/>death of thy Son Jesus Christ, and through faith in his blood,<br/>we, and all thy whole Church, may obtain remission of our<br/>sins, and all other benefits of his passion.</p>
