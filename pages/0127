<p><i>The Officiant begins</i></p>
<p>The Lord Almighty grant us a peaceful night and a perfect<br/>end.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>Officiant</i>  Our help is in the Name of the Lord;</p>
<p><i>People</i>  The maker of heaven and earth.</p>
<p><i>The Officiant may then say</i></p>
<p>Let us confess our sins to God.</p>
<p><i>Officiant and People</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, our heavenly Father:<br/>We have sinned against you,<br/>through our own fault,<br/>in thought, and word, and deed,<br/>and in what we have left undone.<br/>For the sake of your Son our Lord Jesus Christ,<br/>forgive us all our offenses;<br/>and grant that we may serve you<br/>in newness of life,<br/>to the glory of your Name.  Amen.</p>
