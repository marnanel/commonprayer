<h1>Preface to the Ordination Rites</h1>
<p><i>The Holy Scriptures and ancient Christian writers make it clear that<br/>from the apostles' time, there have been different ministries within the<br/>Church.  In particular, since the time of the New Testament, three<br/>distinct orders of ordained ministers have been characteristic of<br/>Christ's holy Catholic Church.  First, there is the order of bishops who<br/>carry on the apostolic work of leading, supervising, and uniting the<br/>Church.  Secondly, associated with them are the presbyters, or ordained<br/>elders, in subsequent times generally known as priests. Together with<br/>the bishops, they take part in the governance of the Church, in the<br/>carrying out of its missionary and pastoral work, and in the preaching<br/>of the Word of God and administering his holy Sacraments.  Thirdly,<br/>there are deacons who assist bishops and priests in all of this work.<br/>It is also a special responsibility of deacons to minister in Christ's<br/>name to the poor, the sick, the suffering, and the helpless.</i></p>
<p><i>The persons who are chosen and recognized by the Church as being called<br/>by God to the ordained ministry are admitted to these sacred orders by<br/>solemn prayer and the laying on of episcopal hands.  It has been, and<br/>is, the intention and purpose of this Church to maintain and continue<br/>these three orders; and for this purpose these services of ordination<br/>and consecration are appointed.  No persons are allowed to exercise the<br/>offices of bishop, priest, or deacon in this Church unless they are so<br/>ordained, or have already received such ordination with the laying on of<br/>hands by bishops who are themselves duly qualified to confer Holy<br/>Orders.</i></p>
<p><i>It is also recognized and affirmed that the threefold ministry is not<br/>the exclusive property of this portion of Christ's catholic Church, but<br/>is a gift from God for the nurture of his people and the proclamation of<br/>his Gospel everywhere.  Accordingly, the manner of ordaining in this<br/>Church is to be such as has been, and is, most generally recognized by<br/>Christian people as suitable for the conferring of the sacred orders of<br/>bishops, priest, and deacon.</i></p>
