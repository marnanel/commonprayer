<h1>Lent</h1>
<p>Through Jesus Christ our Lord; who was tempted in every way as we are,<br/>yet did not sin.  By his grace we are able to triumph over every evil,<br/>and to live no longer for ourselves alone, but for him who died for us<br/>and rose again.</p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>You bid your faithful people cleanse their hearts, and prepare with joy<br/>for the Paschal feast; that, fervent in prayer and in works of</p>
<p>mercy, and renewed by your Word and Sacraments, they may come to the<br/>fullness of grace which you have prepared for those who love you.</p>
<h1>Holy Week</h1>
<p>Through Jesus Christ our Lord.  For our sins he was lifted high upon the<br/>cross, that he might draw the whole world to himself; and, by his<br/>suffering and death, he became the source of eternal salvation for all<br/>who put their trust in him.</p>
<h1>Easter</h1>
<p>But chiefly are we bound to praise you for the glorious resurrection of<br/>your Son Jesus Christ our Lord; for he is the true Paschal Lamb, who was<br/>sacrificed for us, and has taken away the sin of the world. By his death<br/>he has destroyed death, and by his rising to life again he has won for<br/>us everlasting life.</p>
<h1>Ascension</h1>
<p>Through your dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ our Lord.  After his<br/>glorious resurrection he openly appeared to his disciples, and in their<br/>sight ascended into heaven, to prepare a place for us; that where he is,<br/>there we might also be, and reign with him in glory.</p>
