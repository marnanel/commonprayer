<h1>At Confirmation, Reception, or Reaffirmation</h1>
<p><i>The Bishop says to the congregation</i></p>
<p>Let us now pray for <i>these persons</i> who have renewed<br/><i>their</i> commitment to Christ.</p>
<p><i>Silence may be kept.</i></p>
<p><i>Then the Bishop says</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, we thank you that by the death and<br/>resurrection of your Son Jesus Christ you have overcome sin<br/>and brought us to yourself, and that by the sealing of your<br/>Holy Spirit you have bound us to your service.  Renew in<br/><i>these</i> your <i>servants</i> the covenant you made with <i>them</i> at <i>their</i><br/>Baptism.  Send <i>them</i> forth in the power of the Spirit to<br/>perform the service you set before <i>them;</i> through Jesus Christ<br/>your Son our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the<br/>Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<h1>For Confirmation</h1>
<p><i>The Bishop lays hands upon each one and says</i></p>
<p>Strengthen, O Lord, your servant <b><span class="person">N</span></b> with your Holy Spirit;<br/>empower <i>him</i> for your service; and sustain <i>him</i> all the days<br/>of <i>his</i> life. Amen.</p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>Defend, O Lord, your servant <b><span class="person">N</span></b> with your heavenly grace,<br/>that <i>he</i> may continue yours for ever, and daily increase in<br/>your Holy Spirit more and more, until <i>he</i> comes to your<br/>everlasting kingdom.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
