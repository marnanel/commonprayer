<h1>Third Sunday in Lent</h1>
<p>Almighty God, who seest that we have no power of ourselves<br/>to help ourselves:  Keep us both outwardly in our bodies and<br/>inwardly in our souls, that we may be defended from all<br/>adversities which may happen to the body, and from all evil<br/>thoughts which may assault and hurt the soul; through Jesus<br/>Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the<br/>Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p>Gracious Father, whose blessed Son Jesus Christ came down<br/>from heaven to be the true bread which giveth life to the<br/>world:  Evermore give us this bread, that he may live in us,<br/>and we in him; who liveth and reigneth with thee and the<br/>Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<h1>Fifth Sunday in Lent</h1>
<p>O Almighty God, who alone canst order the unruly wills and<br/>affections of sinful men:  Grant unto thy people that they may<br/>love the thing which thou commandest, and desire that<br/>which thou dost promise; that so, among the sundry and<br/>manifold changes of the world, our hearts may surely there<br/>be fixed where true joys are to be found; through Jesus<br/>Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the<br/>Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
