<h1><a href="bible:Psalm+51">Psalm 51</a></h1>  <i>Miserere mei, Deus</i>
<p>1  Have mercy on me, O God, according to your<br/>  loving-kindness; *<br/> in your great compassion blot out my offenses.</p>
<p>2  Wash me through and through from my wickedness *<br/> and cleanse me from my sin.</p>
<p>3  For I know my transgressions, *<br/> and my sin is ever before me.</p>
<p>4  Against you only have I sinned *<br/>and done what is evil in your sight.</p>
<p>5  And so you are justified when you speak *<br/> and upright in your judgment</p>
<p>6  Indeed, I have been wicked from my birth, *<br/> a sinner from my mother's womb.</p>
<p>7  For behold, you look for truth deep within me, *<br/> and will make me understand wisdom secretly.</p>
<p>8  Purge me from my sin, and I shall be pure;<br/>wash me, and I shall be clean indeed.</p>
<p>9  Make me hear of joy and gladness, *<br/> that the body you have broken may rejoice.</p>
<p>10  Hide your face from my sins *<br/> and blot out all my iniquities.</p>
<p>11  Create in me a clean heart, O God, *<br/> and renew a right spirit within me.</p>
<p>12  Cast me not away from your presence *<br/> and take not your holy Spirit from me.</p>
<p>13  Give me the joy of your saving help again *<br/> and sustain me with your bountiful Spirit.</p>
