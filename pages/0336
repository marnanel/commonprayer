<p>And here we offer and present unto thee, O Lord, our selves,<br/>our souls and bodies, to be a reasonable, holy, and living<br/>sacrifice unto thee; humbly beseeching thee that we, and all<br/>others who shall be partakers of this Holy Communion, may<br/>worthily receive the most precious Body and Blood of thy Son<br/>Jesus Christ, be filled with thy grace and heavenly benediction,<br/>and made one body with him, that he may dwell in us, and<br/>we in him.</p>
<p>And although we are unworthy, through our manifold sins,<br/>to offer unto thee any sacrifice, yet we beseech thee to accept<br/>this our bounden duty and service, not weighing our merits,<br/>but pardoning our offences, through Jesus Christ our Lord;</p>
<p>By whom, and with whom, in the unity of the Holy Ghost,<br/>all honor and glory be unto thee, O Father Almighty, world<br/>without end.  AMEN.</p>
<p>And now, as our Savior Christ hath taught us, we are bold<br/>to say,</p>
<p><i>People and Celebrant</i></p>
<p>Our Father, who art in heaven,<br/>  hallowed be thy Name,<br/>  thy kingdom come,<br/>  thy will be done,<br/>    on earth as it is in heaven.<br/>Give us this day our daily bread.<br/>And forgive us our trespasses,<br/>  as we forgive those who trespass against us.<br/>And lead us not into temptation,<br/>  but deliver us from evil.<br/>For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and<br/>ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
