<h1>Sixth Sunday of Easter</h1>
<p>O God, who hast prepared for those who love thee such<br/>good things as pass man's understanding:  Pour into our<br/>hearts such love towards thee, that we, loving thee in all<br/>things and above all things, may obtain thy promises, which<br/>exceed all that we can desire; through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br/>who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, one<br/>God, for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>Preface of Easter</i></p>
<p><i>Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of this week are the traditional<br/>Rogation Days.</i></p>
<h1>Ascension Day</h1>
<p>Almighty God, whose blessed Son our Savior Jesus Christ<br/>ascended far above all heavens that he might fill all things:<br/>Mercifully give us faith to perceive that, according to his<br/>promise, he abides with his Church on earth, even to the<br/>end of the ages; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth<br/>and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, in<br/>glory everlasting.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>Grant, we beseech thee, Almighty God, that as we do<br/>believe thy only-begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ to have<br/>ascended into heaven, so we may also in heart and mind<br/>thither ascend, and with him continually dwell; who liveth<br/>and reigneth with  you and the Holy Spirit, one God, world<br/>without end.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
