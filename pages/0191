<p>Almighty God, whose blessed Son restored Mary Magdalene<br/>to health of body and mind, and called her to be a witness of<br/>his resurrection:  Mercifully grant that by thy grace we may<br/>be healed of all our infirmities and know thee in the power of<br/>his endless life; who with thee and the Holy Spirit liveth and<br/>reigneth, one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<h1>Saint James</h1>  <i>July 25</i>
<p>O gracious God, we remember before thee this day thy<br/>servant and apostle James, first among the Twelve to suffer<br/>martyrdom for the Name of Jesus Christ; and we pray that<br/>thou wilt pour out upon the leaders of thy Church that spirit<br/>of self-denying service by which alone they may have true<br/>authority among thy people; through the same Jesus Christ<br/>our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy<br/>Spirit, one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<h1>The Transfiguration</h1>  <i>August 6</i>
<p>O God, who on the holy mount didst reveal to chosen<br/>witnesses thy well-beloved Son, wonderfully transfigured, in<br/>raiment white and glistening:  Mercifully grant that we, being<br/>delivered from the disquietude of this world, may by faith<br/>behold the King in his beauty; who with thee, O Father, and<br/>thee, O Holy Ghost, liveth and reigneth, one God, world<br/>without end.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
