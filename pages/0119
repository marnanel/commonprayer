<p><i>After each Lesson the Reader may say</i></p>
<p>The Word of the Lord.</p>
<p><i>Answer</i> Thanks be to God.</p>
<p><i>Or the Reader may say</i> Here ends the Lesson (Reading).</p>
<p><i>Silence may be kept after each Reading.  One of the following<br/>Canticles, or one of those on pages <a href="47.html">47</a>-<a href="52.html">52</a>, or 85-95, is sung or said<br/>after each Reading.  If three lessons are used, the Lesson from the<br/>Gospel is read after the second Canticle.</i></p>
<h1>The Song of Mary</h1>  <i>Magnificat</i>
<p><i><a href="bible:Luke+1%3A46-55">Luke 1:46-55</a></i></p>
<p>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,<br/>my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *<br/> for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.</p>
<p>From this day all generations will call me blessed: *<br/> the Almighty has done great things for me,<br/> and holy is his Name.</p>
<p>He has mercy on those who fear him *<br/> in every generation.</p>
<p>He has shown the strength of his arm, *<br/> he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</p>
<p>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *<br/> and has lifted up the lowly.</p>
<p>He has filled the hungry with good things, *<br/> and the rich he has sent away empty.</p>
<p>He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *<br/> for he has remembered his promise of mercy,</p>
<p>The promise he made to our fathers, *<br/> to Abraham and his children for ever.</p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br/> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.</p>
