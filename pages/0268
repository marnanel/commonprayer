<p>We confess to you, Lord, all our past unfaithfulness: the<br/>pride, hypocrisy, and impatience of our lives,<br/><i>We confess to you, Lord.</i></p>
<p>Our self-indulgent appetites and ways, and our exploitation<br/>of other people,<br/><i>We confess to you, Lord.</i></p>
<p>Our anger at our own frustration, and our envy of those<br/>more fortunate than ourselves,<br/><i>We confess to you, Lord.</i></p>
<p>Our intemperate love of worldly goods and comforts, and<br/>our dishonesty in daily life and work,<br/><i>We confess to you, Lord.</i></p>
<p>Our negligence in prayer and worship, and our failure to<br/>commend the faith that is in us,<br/><i>We confess to you, Lord.</i></p>
<p>Accept our repentance, Lord, for the wrongs we have done:<br/>for our blindness to human need and suffering, and our<br/>indifference to injustice and cruelty,<br/><i>Accept our repentance, Lord.</i></p>
<p>For all false judgments, for uncharitable thoughts toward our<br/>neighbors, and for our prejudice and contempt toward those<br/>who differ from us,<br/><i>Accept our repentance, Lord.</i></p>
<p>For our waste and pollution of your creation, and our lack of<br/>concern for those who come after us,<br/><i>Accept our repentance, Lord.</i></p>
<p>Restore us, good Lord, and let your anger depart from us;<br/>=Favorably hear us, for your mercy is great.</p>
<p>Accomplish in us the work of your salvation,<br/><i>That we may show forth your glory in the world.</i></p>
