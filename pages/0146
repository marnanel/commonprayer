<h1><a href="bible:Psalm+95">Psalm 95</a>:  Traditional</h1> <i>Venite, exultemus</i>
<p>O come, let us sing unto the Lord; *<br/> let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our salvation.</p>
<p>Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, *<br/> and show ourselves glad in him with psalms.</p>
<p>For the Lord is a great God, *<br/> and a great King above all gods.</p>
<p>In his hand are all the corners of the earth, *<br/> and the strength of the hills are his also.</p>
<p>The sea is his and he made it, *<br/> and his hands prepared the dry land.</p>
<p>O come, let us worship and fall down *<br/> and kneel before the Lord our Maker.</p>
<p>For he is the lord our God, *<br/> and we are the people of his pasture<br/> and the sheep of his hand.</p>
<p>Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts *<br/> as in the provocation,<br/> and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness;</p>
<p>When your fathers tempted me, *<br/> proved me, and saw my works.</p>
<p>Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, *<br/> It is a people that do err in their hearts,<br/> for they have not known my ways.</p>
<p>Unto whom I sware in my wrath, *<br/> that they should not enter into my rest.</p>
