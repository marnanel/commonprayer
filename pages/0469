<h1>The Burial of the Dead:<br/>Rite One</h1>
<p><i>All stand while one or more of the following anthems are sung or said</i></p>
<p>I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord;<br/>he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live;<br/>and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.</p>
<p>I know that my Redeemer liveth,<br/>and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth;<br/>and though this body be destroyed, yet shall I see God;<br/>whom I shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold,<br/>and not as a stranger.</p>
<p>For none of us liveth to himself,<br/>and no man dieth to himself.<br/>For if we live, we live unto the Lord.<br/>and if we die, we die unto the Lord.<br/>Whether we live, therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.</p>
<p>Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord;<br/>even so saith the Spirit, for they rest from their labors.</p>
<p><i>The Celebrant says one of the following Collects, first saying</i></p>
<p>The Lord be with you.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  And with thy spirit.</p>
<p><i>Celebrant</i> Let us pray.</p>
