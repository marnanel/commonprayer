<h1>The Consecration of a Grave</h1>
<p><i>If the grave is in a place that has not previously been set apart for<br/>Christian burial, the Priest may use the following prayer, either before<br/>the service of Committal or at some other convenient time.</i></p>
<p>O God, whose blessed Son was laid in a sepulcher in the<br/>garden:  Bless, we pray, this grave, and grant that <i>he</i> whose<br/>body is (is to be) buried here may dwell with Christ in<br/>paradise, and may come to thy heavenly kingdom; through<br/>thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<h1>Additional Prayers</h1>
<p>Almighty and everliving God, we yield unto thee most high<br/>praise and hearty thanks for the wonderful grace and virtue<br/>declared in all thy saints, who have been the choice vessels<br/>of thy grace, and the lights of the world in their several<br/>generations; most humbly beseeching thee to give us grace so<br/>to follow the example of their steadfastness in thy faith, and<br/>obedience to thy holy commandments, that at the day of the<br/>general resurrection, we, with all those who are of the<br/>mystical body of thy Son, may be set on his right hand, and<br/>hear that his most joyful voice:  "Come, ye blessed of my<br/>Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the<br/>foundation of the world."  Grant this, O Father, for the sake<br/>of the same thy Son Jesus Christ, our only Mediator and<br/>Advocate.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
