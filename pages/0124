<p><i>A Collect for Projection</i></p>
<p>O God, the life of all who live, the light of the faithful, the<br/>strength of those who labor, and the repose of the dead:  We<br/>thank you for the blessings of the day that is past, and<br/>humbly ask for your protection through the coming night.<br/>Bring us in safety to the morning hours; through him who<br/>died and rose again for us, your Son our Savior Jesus Christ.<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>A Collect for the Presence of Christ</i></p>
<p>Lord Jesus, stay with us, for evening is at hand and the day<br/>is past; be our companion in the way, kindle our hearts, and<br/>awaken hope, that we may know you as you are revealed in<br/>Scripture and the breaking of bread.  Grant this for the sake<br/>of your love.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>Then, unless the Eucharist or a form of general intercession is to<br/>follow, one of these prayer for mission is added</i></p>
<p>O God and Father of all, whom the whole heavens adore:<br/>Let the whole earth also worship you, all nations obey you,<br/>all tongues confess and bless you, and mean and women<br/>everywhere love you and serve you in peace; through Jesus<br/>Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>Keep watch, dear Lord, with those who work, or watch, or<br/>weep this night, and give your angels charge over those who<br/>sleep.  Tend the sick, Lord Christ; give rest to the weary, bless<br/>the dying, soothe the suffering, pity the afflicted, shield the<br/>joyous; and all for your love's sake.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>or the following</i></p>
