<h1>The Celebration and<br/>Blessing of a Marriage</h1>
<p><i>At the time appointed, the persons to be married, with their witnesses,<br/>assemble in the church or some other appropriate place.</i></p>
<p><i>During their entrance, a hymn, psalm, or anthem may be sung, or<br/>instrumental music may be played.</i></p>
<p><i>Then the Celebrant, facing the people and the persons to be married,<br/>with the woman to the right and the man to the left, addresses the<br/>congregation and says</i></p>
<p>Dearly beloved: We have come together in the presence of<br/>God to witness and bless the joining together of this man and<br/>this woman in Holy Matrimony.  The bond and covenant of<br/>marriage was established by God in creation, and our Lord<br/>Jesus Christ adorned this manner of life by his presence and<br/>first miracle at a wedding in Cana of Galilee.  It signifies to us<br/>the mystery of the union between Christ and his Church, and<br/>Holy Scripture commends it to be honored among all people.</p>
<p>The union of husband and wife in heart, body, and mind is<br/>intended by God for their mutual joy; for the help and comfort<br/>given one another in prosperity and adversity; and, when it is<br/>God's will, for the procreation of children and their nurture<br/>in the knowledge and love of the Lord.  Therefore marriage is<br/>not to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly, but reverently,<br/>deliberately, and in accordance with the purposes for which it<br/>was instituted by God.</p>
