<p><i>If the church is also to be used for regular worship by other Christian<br/>bodies, it is appropriate that their representatives take part in the<br/>service, and that the service be adapted.</i></p>
<p><i>Suitable portions of this service may be used by the bishop, or by a<br/>priest with the bishop's permission, for dedicating a private chapel or<br/>oratory.</i></p>
<p><i>For the Dedication of Furnishings,<br/>or Parts of a Church or Chapel</i></p>
<p><i>Relevant portions of the service for the Dedication and Consecration of<br/>a Church may be used by the bishop or a priest for blessing alterations,<br/>additions, or new furnishings in a church or chapel.  In each such case,<br/>the appropriate prayer may be said, or adapted to the circumstances; and<br/>prayers and Bible readings related to the particular occasion may be<br/>selected.  When possible, the areas or furnishings should be put into<br/>use at this time.</i></p>
<p><i>The blessing of a new font or baptistry should always be done by a<br/>bishop, and should be followed, if possible, by the administration of<br/>Holy Baptism.</i></p>
<p><i>The blessing of an Altar is also reserved for a bishop, and is always<br/>to be followed by the celebration of the Holy Eucharist.</i></p>
<p><i>For a Church or Chapel Long in Use</i></p>
<p><i>When buildings have been used for public worship for an extended period<br/>of time without having been consecrated, the following order may provide<br/>an opportunity for the congregation to reaffirm its commitment to its<br/>mission and ministry, and it will be particularly appropriate when a<br/>congregation attains recognition as a parish.</i></p>
