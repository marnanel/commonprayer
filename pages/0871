<h1>XVII.  Of Predestination and Election</h1>
<p>Predestination to Life is the everlasting purpose of God, whereby<br/>(before the foundations of the world were laid) he hath constantly<br/>decreed by his counsel secret to us, to deliver from curse and damnation<br/>those whom he hath chosen in Christ out of mankind, and to bring them by<br/>Christ to everlasting salvation, as vessels made to honour.  Wherefore,<br/>they which be endued with so excellent a benefit of God, be called<br/>according to God's purpose by his Spirit working in due season: they<br/>through Grace obey the calling: they be justified freely: they be made<br/>sons of God by adoption: they be made like the image of his only-<br/>begotten Son Jesus Christ: they walk religiously in good works, and at<br/>length, by God's mercy, they attain to everlasting felicity.</p>
<p>As the godly consideration of Predestination, and our Election in<br/>Christ, is full of sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable comfort to godly<br/>persons, and such as feel in themselves the working of the Spirit of<br/>Christ, mortifying the works of the flesh, and their earthly members,<br/>and drawing up their mind to high and heavenly things, as well because<br/>it doth greatly establish and confirm their faith of eternal Salvation<br/>to be enjoyed through Christ, as because it doth fervently kindle their<br/>love towards God: So, for curious and carnal persons, lacking the Spirit<br/>of Christ, to have continually before their eyes the sentence of God's<br/>Predestination, is a most dangerous downfall, whereby the Devil doth<br/>thrust them either into desperation, or into wrethchlessness of most<br/>unclean living, no less perilous than desperation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we must receive God's promises in such wise, as they be<br/>generally set forth to us in Holy Scripture: and, in our doings, that<br/>Will of God is to be followed, which we have expressly declared unto us<br/>in the word of God.</p>
<h1>XVIII.  Of obtaining eternal Salvation only by the Name of Christ</h1>
<p>They also are to be had accursed that presume to say, That every man<br/>shall be saved by the Law or Sect which he professeth, so that he be<br/>diligent to frame his life according to that Law, and the light of<br/>Nature.  For Holy Scripture doth set out unto us only the Name of Jesus<br/>Christ, whereby men must be saved.</p>
<h1>XIX.  Of the Church.</h1>
<p>The visible Church of Christ is a congregation of faithful men, in which<br/>the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be duly ministered<br/>according to Christ's ordinance, in all those things that of necessity<br/>are requisite to the same.</p>
<p>As the Church of Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch, have erred; so also<br/>the Church of Rome hath erred, not only in their living and manner of<br/>Ceremonies, but also in matters of Faith.</p>
<h1>XX.  Of the Authority of the Church.</h1>
<p>The Church hath power to decree Rites or Ceremonies, and authority in<br/>Controversies of Faith: and yet it is not lawful for the Church to<br/>ordain anything that is contrary to God's Word written, neither may it<br/>so expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another.<br/>Wherefore, although the Church be a witness and a keeper of Holy Writ,<br/>yet, as it ought not to decree any thing against the same, so besides<br/>the same ought not to enforce any thing to be believed for necessity of<br/>Salvation.</p>
