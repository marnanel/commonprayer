<h1>A Litany of Thanksgiving for a Church</h1>
<p>Let us thank God whom we worship here in the beauty of<br/>holiness.</p>
<p>Eternal God, the heaven of heavens cannot contain you,<br/>much less the walls of temples made with hands.  Graciously<br/>receive our thanks for this place, and accept the work of our<br/>hands, offered to your honor and glory.</p>
<p>For the Church universal, of which these visible buildings are<br/>the symbol,<br/><i>We thank you, Lord.</i></p>
<p>For your presence whenever two or three have gathered<br/>together in your Name,<br/><i>We thank you, Lord.</i></p>
<p>For this place where we may be still and know that you<br/>are God,<br/><i>We thank you, Lord.</i></p>
<p>For making us your children by adoption and grace, and<br/>refreshing us day by day with the bread of life.<br/><i>We thank you, Lord.</i></p>
<p>For the knowledge of your will and the grace to perform it,<br/><i>We thank you, Lord.</i></p>
<p>For the fulfilling of our desires and petitions as you see<br/>best for us,<br/><i>We thank you, Lord.</i></p>
