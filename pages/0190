<h1>The Nativity of Saint John the Baptist</h1>  <i>June 24</i>
<p>Almighty God, by whose providence thy servant John the<br/>Baptist was wonderfully born, and sent to prepare the way of<br/>thy Son our Savior by preaching repentance: Make us so to<br/>follow his doctrine and holy life, that we may truly repent<br/>according to his preaching; and, after his example, constantly<br/>speak the truth, boldly rebuke vice, and patiently suffer for<br/>the truth's sake; through the same Jesus Christ thy Son our<br/>Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit,<br/>one God, for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<h1>Saint Peter and Saint Paul</h1>  <i>June 29</i>
<p>Almighty God, whose blessed apostles Peter and Paul<br/>glorified you by their martyrdom: Grant that thy Church,<br/>instructed by their teaching and example, and knit together<br/>in unity by thy Spirit, may ever stand firm upon the one<br/>foundation, which is Jesus Christ our Lord; who liveth and<br/>reigneth with thee, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God,<br/>now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
