<h1>Definition of the Union of the Divine<br/>and Human Natures in the Person of Christ</h1>
<p><i>Council of Chalcedon, 451 A.D., Act V</i></p>
<p>Therefore, following the holy fathers, we all with one accord teach men<br/>to acknowledge one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, at once<br/>complete in Godhead and complete in manhood, truly God and truly man,<br/>consisting also of a reasonable soul and body; of one substance<br/>(homoousios) with the Father as regards his Godhead, and at the same<br/>time of one substance with us as regards his manhood; like us in all<br/>respects, apart from sin; as regards his Godhead, begotten of the Father<br/>before the ages, but yet as regards his manhood begotten, for us men and<br/>for our salvation, of Mary the Virgin, the God-bearer (Theotokos); one<br/>and the same Christ, Son, Lord, Only-begotten, recognized in two<br/>natures, without confusion, without change, without division, without<br/>separation; the distinction of natures being in no way annulled by the<br/>union, but rather the characteristics of each nature being preserved and<br/>coming together to form one person and subsistence, not as parted or<br/>separated into two persons, but one and the same Son and Only-begotten<br/>God the Word, Lord Jesus Christ; even as the prophets from earliest<br/>times spoke of him, and our Lord Jesus Christ himself taught us, and the<br/>creed of the Fathers has handed down to us.</p>

<h1>The Creed of Saint Athanasius</h1>
<p>Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he  hold<br/>the Catholic Faith.</p>
<p>Which Faith except everyone do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt<br/>he shall perish everlastingly.</p>
<p>And the Catholic Faith is this: That we worship one God in Trinity,  and<br/>Trinity in Unity, neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing  the<br/>Substance.</p>
<p>For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, and another<br/>of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is<br/>all one, the Glory equal, the Majesty co-eternal.</p>
<p>Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>The Father uncreate, the Son uncreate, and the Holy Ghost uncreate.</p>
<p>The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible, and the Holy<br/>Ghost incomprehensible.</p>
<p>The Father eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy Ghost eternal.</p>
<p>And yet they are not three eternals, but one eternal.</p>
<p>As also there are not three incomprehensibles, nor three uncreated,  but<br/>one uncreated, and one incomprehensible.</p>
<p>So likewise the Father is Almighty, the Son Almighty, and the Holy<br/>Ghost Almighty.</p>
<p>And yet they are not three Almighties, but one Almighty.</p>
