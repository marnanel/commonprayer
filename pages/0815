More especially we pray for<br/>thy holy Church universal; that it may be so guided and<br/>governed by thy good Spirit, that all who profess and call<br/>themselves Christians may be led into the way of truth, and<br/>hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in<br/>righteousness of life.  Finally, we commend to thy fatherly<br/>goodness all those who are in any ways afflicted or distressed,<br/>in mind, body, or estate; [especially those for whom our prayers<br/>are desired]; that it may please thee to comfort and relieve<br/>them according to their several necessities, giving them patience<br/>under their sufferings, and a happy issue out of all their<br/>afflictions.  And this we beg for Jesus Christ's sake.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>3.  For the Human Family</i></p>
<p>O God, you made us in your own image and redeemed us<br/>through Jesus your Son:  Look with compassion on the whole<br/>human family; take away the arrogance and hatred which<br/>infect our hearts; break down the walls that separate us;<br/>unite us in bonds of love; and work through our struggle and<br/>confusion to accomplish your purposes on earth; that, in<br/>your good time, all nations and races may serve you in<br/>harmony around your heavenly throne; through Jesus Christ<br/>our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p>Eternal God, in whose perfect kingdom no sword is drawn<br/>but the sword of righteousness, no strength known but the<br/>strength of love:  So mightily spread abroad your Spirit, that<br/>all peoples may be gathered under the banner of the Prince of<br/>Peace, as children of one Father; to whom be dominion and<br/>glory, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
