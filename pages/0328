<p>being of one substance with the Father;<br/>    by whom all things were made;<br/>    who for us men and for our salvation<br/>        came down from heaven,<br/>and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary,<br/>        and was made man;<br/>    and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate;<br/>    he suffered and was buried;<br/>and the third day he rose again according to the Scriptures,<br/>    and ascended into heaven,<br/>    and sitteth on the right hand of the Father;<br/>    and he shall come again, with glory,<br/>        to judge both the quick and the dead;<br/>    whose kingdom shall have no end.<br/>And I believe in the Holy Ghost the Lord, and Giver of Life, who<br/>proceedeth from the Father and the Son;<br/>    who with the Father and the Son together is worshiped<br/>        and glorified;<br/>    who spake by the Prophets.<br/>    And I believe one holy Catholic and Apostolic Church;<br/>I acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins;<br/>    and I look for the resurrection of the dead,<br/>        and the life of the world to come.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
