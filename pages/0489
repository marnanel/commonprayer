<p>O God, whose days are without end, and whose mercies<br/>cannot be numbered:  Make us, we beseech thee, deeply<br/>sensible of the shortness and uncertainty of life; and let thy<br/>Holy Spirit lead us in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br/>that, when we shall have served thee in our generation, we<br/>may be gathered unto our fathers, having the testimony of a<br/>good conscience; in the communion of the Catholic Church;<br/>in the confidence of a certain faith; in the comfort of a<br/>reasonable, religious, and holy hope; in favor with thee our<br/>God; and in perfect charity with the world.  All which we ask<br/>through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>O God, the King of saints, we praise and magnify thy holy<br/>Name for all thy servants who have finished their course in<br/>thy faith and fear; for the blessed Virgin Mary; for the holy<br/>patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs; and for all other<br/>thy righteous servants, known to us and unknown; and we<br/>beseech thee that, encouraged by their examples, aided by<br/>their prayers, and strengthened by their fellowship, we also<br/>may be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light;<br/>through the merits of thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, we pray thee to<br/>set thy passion, cross, and death, between thy judgment and<br/>our souls, now and in the hour of our death.  Give mercy and<br/>grace to the living, pardon and rest to the dead, to thy holy<br/>Church peace and concord, and to us sinners everlasting life<br/>and glory; who with the Father and the Holy Spirit livest and<br/>reignest, one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, Father of mercies and giver of comfort:<br/>Deal graciously, we pray thee, with all those who mourn, that<br/>casting every care on thee, they may know the consolation of<br/>thy love; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
