<p>things once advisedly established, she hath, in the reign of several<br/>Princes, since the first compiling of her Liturgy in the time of Edward<br/>the Sixth, upon just and weighty considerations her thereunto moving,<br/>yielded to make such alterations in some particulars, as in their<br/>respective times were thought convenient; yet so as that the main body<br/>and essential parts of the same (as well in the chiefest materials, as<br/>in the frame and order thereof) have still been continued firm and<br/>unshaken</p>
<p>Her general aim in these different reviews and alterations hath been, as<br/>she further declares in her said Preface, to do that which, according to<br/>her best understanding, might most tend to the preservation of peace and<br/>unity in the Church; the procuring of reverence, and the exciting of<br/>piety and devotion in the worship of God; and, finally, the cutting off<br/>occasion, from them that seek occasion, of cavil or quarrel against her<br/>Liturgy.

<p>But when in the course of Divine Providence, these American States<br/>became independent with respect to civil government, their<br/>ecclesiastical independence was necessarily included; and the different<br/>religious denominations of Christians in these States were left at full<br/>and equal liberty to model and organize their respective Churches, and<br/>forms of worship, and discipline, in such manner as they might judge<br/>most convenient for their future prosperity; consistently with the<br/>constitution and laws of their country.</p>
<p>The attention of this Church was in the first place drawn to those<br/>alterations in the Liturgy which became necessary in the prayers for our<br/>Civil Rulers, in consequence of the Revolution.  And the principal care<br/>herein was to make them conformable to what ought to be the proper<br/>end of all such prayers, namely, that "Rulers may have grace, wisdom,</p>
