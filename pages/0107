<p>Heavenly Father, send your Holy Spirit into our hearts, to<br/>direct and rule us according to your will, to comfort us in all<br/>our afflictions, to defend us from all error, and to lead us into<br/>all truth; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>Blessed Savior, at this hour you hung upon the cross,<br/>stretching out your loving arms:  Grant that all the peoples of<br/>the earth may look to you and be saved;  for your tender<br/>mercies' sake.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>Almighty Savior, who at noonday called your servant Saint<br/>Paul to be an apostle to the Gentiles:  We pray you to illumine<br/>the world with the radiance of your glory, that all nations<br/>may come and worship you; for you live and reign for ever<br/>and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, you said to your apostles, "Peace I give to<br/>you; my peace I leave with you:" Regard not our sins,<br/>but the faith of your Church, and give to us the peace and<br/>unity of that heavenly city, where with the Father and the<br/>Holy Spirit you live and reign, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
