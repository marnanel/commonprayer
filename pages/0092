<p>From this day all generations will call me blessed: *<br/> the Almighty has done great things for me,<br/> and holy is his Name.</p>
<p>He has mercy on those who fear him *<br/> in every generation.</p>
<p>He has shown the strength of his arm, *<br/> he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</p>
<p>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *<br/> and has lifted up the lowly.</p>
<p>He has filled the hungry with good things, *<br/> and the rich he has sent away empty.</p>
<p>He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *<br/> for he has remembered his promise of mercy,</p>
<p>The promise he made to our fathers, *<br/> to Abraham and his children for ever.</p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br/> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.</p>
<h1>Canticle 16</h1>  The Song of Zechariah  <i>Benedictus Dominus Deus</i>
<p><i><a href="bible:Luke+1">Luke 1</a>: 68-79</i></p>
<p>Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel; *<br/> he has come to his people and set them free.</p>
<p>He has raised up for us a mighty savior, *<br/> born of the house of his servant David.</p>
<p>Through his holy prophets he promised of old,<br/>that he would save us from our enemies, *<br/> from the hands of all who hate us.</p>
<p>He promised to show mercy to our fathers *<br/> and to remember his holy covenant.</p>
<p>This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham, *<br/> to set us free from the hands of our enemies,</p>
<p>Free to worship him without fear, *<br/> holy and righteous in his sight<br/> all the days of our life.</p>
