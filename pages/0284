<h1>Concerning the Vigil</h1>
<p><i>The Great Vigil, when observed, is the first service of Easter Day. It<br/>is celebrated at a convenient time between sunset on Holy Saturday and<br/>sunrise on Easter Morning.</i></p>
<p><i>The service normally consists of four parts:</i></p>
<p>1.  The Service of Light.</p>
<p>2.  The Service of Lessons.</p>
<p>3.  Christian Initiation, or the Renewal of Baptismal Vows.</p>
<p>4.  The Holy Eucharist with the administration of Easter Communion.</p>
<p><i>It is customary for all the ordained ministry present, together with<br/>lay readers, singers, and other persons, to take active parts in the<br/>service.</i></p>
<p><i>The bishop, when present, is the chief celebrant, presides at Baptism<br/>and administers Communion, and normally preaches the sermon.</i></p>
<p><i>The priests who are present share among them the reading of the<br/>Collects which follow each Lesson, and assist at Baptism and the<br/>Eucharist.  In the absence of a bishop, a priest presides at the<br/>service.</i></p>
<p><i>It is the prerogative of a deacon to carry the Paschal Candle to its<br/>place, and to chant the Exsultet.  Deacons likewise assist at Baptism<br/>and the Eucharist according to their order.</i></p>
<p><i>Lay persons should read the Lessons and the Epistle, and assist in<br/>other ways.  A lay person may be assigned to chant the Exsultet.  It is<br/>desirable that each Lesson be read by a different reader.</i></p>
<p><i>In the absence of a bishop or priest, a deacon or lay reader may lead<br/>the first two parts of the service, the Renewal of Baptismal Vows, and<br/>the Ministry of the Word of the Vigil Eucharist, concluding with the<br/>Prayers of the People, the Lord's Prayer, and the Dismissal.</i></p>
<p><i>A deacon may also, when the services of a priest cannot be obtained,<br/>and with the authorization of the bishop, officiate at public Baptism;<br/>and may administer Easter Communion from the Sacrament previously<br/>consecrated.</i></p>
<p><i>When the Vigil is not celebrated, the Service of Light may take place<br/>at a convenient time before the Liturgy on Easter Day.</i></p>
