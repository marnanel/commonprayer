<p><i>Concerning the Service</i></p>
<p><i>This order is for use when a priest is being instituted and inducted as<br/>the rector of a parish.  It may also be used for the installation of<br/>deans and canons of cathedrals, or the inauguration of other ministries,<br/>diocesan or parochial, including vicars of missions and assistant<br/>ministers.  Alterations in the service are then made according to<br/>circumstances.</i></p>
<p><i>The chief minister is normally the bishop; but, if necessary, a deputy<br/>may be appointed.  The bishop, when present, is the chief celebrant of<br/>the Eucharist.  In the bishop's absence, a priest being inducted is the<br/>chief celebrant.</i></p>
<p><i>Other priests, if any, who serve in the same congregation also stand<br/>with the chief celebrant at the Altar, and deacons assist according to<br/>their order.</i></p>
<p><i>Lay persons from the congregation read the Old Testament Lesson and the<br/>Epistle, and perform other actions as indicated in the rubrics.  A<br/>deacon or priest reads the Gospel.  Other clergy of the diocese<br/>participate in this celebration as an expression of the collegiality of<br/>the ministry in which they share.</i></p>
<p><i>Ministers of other Churches may appropriately be invited to<br/>participate.</i></p>
<p><i>The new minister, if a deacon, should read the Gospel, prepare the<br/>elements at the Offertory, assist the celebration at the Altar, and<br/>dismiss the congregation.</i></p>
<p><i>A lay person being instituted should read one of the Lessons and assist<br/>where appropriate.</i></p>
