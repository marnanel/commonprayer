<p><i>49.  For the Aged</i></p>
<p>Look with mercy, O God our Father, on all whose increasing<br/>years bring them weakness, distress, or isolation.  Provide for<br/>them homes of dignity and peace; give them understanding<br/>helpers, and the willingness to accept help; and, as their<br/>strength diminishes, increase their faith and their assurance<br/>of your love.  This we ask in the name of Jesus Christ our<br/>Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>50.  For a Birthday</i></p>
<p>O God, our times are in your hand:  Look with favor, we<br/>pray, on you servant <b><span class="person">N</span></b> as <i>he</i> begins another year.  Grant<br/>that <i>he</i> may grow in wisdom and grace, and strengthen <i>his</i><br/>trust in your goodness all the days of <i>his</i> life; through Jesus<br/>Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>51.  For a Birthday</i></p>
<p>Watch over thy child, O Lord, as <i>his</i> days increase; bless and<br/>guide <i>him</i> wherever <i>he</i> may be.  Strengthen <i>him</i> when <i>he</i><br/>stands; comfort <i>him</i> when discouraged or sorrowful; raise<br/><i>him</i> up if <i>he</i> fall; and in <i>his</i> heart may thy peace which<br/>passeth understanding abide all the days of <i>his</i> life;<br/>through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>52.  For the Absent</i></p>
<p>O God, whose fatherly care <i>reacheth</i> to the uttermost parts<br/>of the earth:  We humbly beseech <i>thee</i> graciously to behold<br/>and bless whom we love, now absent from us.  Defend<br/>them from all dangers of soul and body; and grant that both<br/>they and we, drawing nearer to <i>thee</i>, may be bound together<br/>by <i>thy</i> love in the communion of <i>thy</i> Holy Spirit, and in the<br/>fellowship of <i>thy</i> saints; through Jesus Christ our Lord.<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>
