<h1>An Exhortation</h1>
<p><i>This Exhortation may be used, in whole or in part, either during the<br/>Liturgy or at other times.  In the absence of a deacon or priest, this<br/>Exhortation may be read by a lay person.  The people stand or sit.</i></p>
<p>Beloved in the Lord: Our Savior Christ, on the night before<br/>he suffered, instituted the Sacrament of his Body and<br/>Blood as a sign and pledge of his love, for the continual<br/>remembrance of the sacrifice of his death, and for a spiritual<br/>sharing in his risen life.  For in these holy Mysteries we are<br/>made one with Christ, and Christ with us; we are made one<br/>body in him, and members one of another.</p>
<p>Having in mind, therefore, his great love for us, and in<br/>obedience to his command, his Church renders to Almighty<br/>God our heavenly Father never-ending thanks for the<br/>creation of the world, for his continual providence over us,<br/>for his love for all mankind, and for the redemption of the<br/>world by our Savior Christ, who took upon himsely our flesh,<br/>and humbled himself even to death on the cross, that he<br/>might make us the children of God by the power of the Holy<br/>Spirit, and exalt us to everlasting life.</p>
<p>But if we are to share rightly in the celebration of those holy<br/>Mysteries, and be nourished by that spritual Food, we must remember<br/>the dignity of that holy Sacrament.  I therefore call<br/>upon you to consider how Saint Paul exhorts all persons to<br/>prepare themselves carefully before eating of that Bread and<br/>drinking of that Cup.</p>
<p>For, as the benefit is great, if with penitent hearts and living<br/>faith we receive the holy Sacrament, so is the danger great, if<br/>we receive it improperly, not recognizing the Lord's Body.<br/>Judge yourselves, therefore, lest you me judged by the Lord.</p>
