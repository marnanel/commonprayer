<p><i>If there is not to be a Communion, one or more of the prayers may be<br/>omitted.</i></p>
<p>Let us pray.</p>
<p>Eternal God, creator and preserver of all life, author of<br/>salvation, and giver of all grace: Look with favor upon<br/>the world you have made, and for which your Son gave his life,<br/>and especially upon this man and this woman whom you<br/>make one flesh in Holy Matrimony.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>Give them wisdom and devotion in the ordering of their<br/>common life, that each may be to the other a strength in need, a<br/>counselor in perplexity, a comfort in sorrow, and a companion<br/>in joy.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>Grant that their wills may be so knit together in your will,<br/>and their spirits in your Spirit, that they may grow in love<br/>and peace with you and one another all the days of their life.<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>Give them grace, when they hurt each other, to recognize and<br/>acknowledge their fault, and to seek each other's forgiveness<br/>and yours.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>Make their life together a sign of Christ's love to this sinful<br/>and broken world, that unity may overcome estrangement, forgiveness<br/>heal guilt, and joy conquer despair.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>[[Bestow on them, if it is your will, the gift and heritage of<br/>children, and the grace to bring them up to know you, to love you,<br/>and to serve you.  <i>Amen.</i>]]</p>
<p>Give them such fulfillment of their mutual affection that they<br/>may reach out in love and concern for others.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
