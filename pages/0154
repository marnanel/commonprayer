<h1>The Supplication</h1>
<p><i>For use in the Litany in place of the Versicle and Collect which<br/>follows the Lord's Prayer; or at the end or Morning or Evening Prayer;<br/>or as a separate devotion; especially in times of war, or of national<br/>anxiety, or of disaster.</i></p>
<p>O Lord, arise, help us;<br/><i>And deliver us for thy Name's sake.</i></p>
<p>O God, we have heard with our ears, and our fathers have<br/>declared unto us, the noble works that thou didst in their<br/>days, and in the old time before them.</p>
<p><i>O Lord, arise, help us;<br/>and deliver us for thy Name's sake.</i></p>
<p>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy<br/>Ghost; as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br/>world without end. Amen.</p>
<p><i>O Lord, arise, help us;<br/>and deliver us for thy Name's sake.</i></p>
