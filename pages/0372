<p>Lord God of our Fathers: God of Abraham, Isaac, and<br/>Jacob; God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: Open our<br/>eyes to see your hand at work in the world about us.  Deliver<br/>us from the presumption of coming to this Table for solace<br/>only, and not for strength; for pardon only, and not for<br/>renewal.  Let the grace of this Holy Communion make us one<br/>body, one spirit in Christ, that we may worthily serve the<br/>world in his name.<br/><i>Risen Lord, be known to us in the breaking of the Bread.</i></p>
<p>Accept these prayers and praises, Father, through Jesus<br/>Christ our great High Priest, to whom, with you and the<br/>Holy Spirit, your Church gives honor, glory, and worship,<br/>from generation to generation.  <i>AMEN.</i></p>

<p>The Lord be with you.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  And also with you.</p>
<p><i>Celebrant</i>  Lift up your hearts.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  We lift them to the Lord.</p>
<p><i>Celebrant</i>  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  It is right to give him thanks and praise.</p>
