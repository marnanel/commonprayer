<p>Almighty and everliving God, who in thy holy Word hast<br/>taught us to make prayers, and supplications, and to give<br/>thanks for all men:  Receive these our prayers which we offer<br/>unto thy divine Magesty, beseeching thee to inspire<br/>continually the Universal Church with the spirit of truth,<br/>unity, and concord; and grant that all those who do confess<br/>thy holy Name may agree in the truth of thy holy Word, and<br/>live in unity and godly love.</p>
<p>Give grace, O heavenly Father, to all bishops and other<br/>ministers [especially __________], that they may, both by<br/>their life and doctrine, set forth thy true and lively Word,<br/>and rightly and duly administer thy holy Sacraments.</p>
<p>And to all thy people give thy heavenly grace, and especially<br/>to this congregation here present; that, with meek heart and<br/>due reverence, they may hear and receive thy holy Word,<br/>truly serving thee in holiness and righteousness all the days<br/>of their life.</p>
<p>We beseech thee also so to rule the hearts of those who bear<br/>the authority of government in this and every land [especially<br/>__________], that they may be led to wise decisions and right<br/>actions for the welfare and peace of the world.</p>
<p>Open, O Lord, the eyes of all people to behold thy gracious<br/>hand in all thy works, that, rejoicing in thy whole creation,<br/>they may honor thee with their substance, and be faithful<br/>stewards of thy bounty.</p>
<p>And we most humbly beseech thee, of thy goodness, O Lord,<br/>to comfort and succor [__________ and] all those who, in this<br/>transitory life, are in trouble, sorrow, need, sickness, or any<br/>other adversity.</p>
