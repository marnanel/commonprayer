<p><i>If the body is not present, the service continues with the [blessing<br/>and] dismissal.</i></p>
<p><i>Unless the Committal follows immediately in the church, the following<br/>Commendation is used.</i></p>
<h1>The Commendation</h1>
<p><i>The Celebrant and other ministers take their places at the body.</i></p>
<p><i>This anthem, or some other suitable anthem, or a hymn, may be sung or<br/>said</i></p>
<p>Give rest, O Christ, to your servant(s) with your saints,<br/><i>where sorrow and pain are no more,<br/>neither sighing, but life everlasting.</i></p>
<p>You only are immortal, the creator and maker of mankind;<br/>and we are mortal, formed of the earth, and to earth shall we<br/>return.  For so did you ordain when you created me, saying,<br/>"You are dust, and to dust you shall return."  All of us go down<br/>to the dust; yet even at the grave we make our song: Alleluia,<br/>alleluia, alleluia.</p>
<p><i>Give rest, O Christ, to your servant(s) with your saints,<br/>where sorrow and pain are no more,<br/>neither sighing, but life everlasting.</i></p>
<p><i>The Celebrant, facing the body, says</i></p>
<p>Into your hands, O merciful Savior, we commend your<br/>servant <b><span class="person">N</span></b> Acknowledge, we humbly beseech you, a sheep of<br/>your own fold, a lamb of your own flock, a sinner of your<br/>own redeeming.  Receive <i>him</i> into the arms of your mercy,<br/>into the blessed rest of everlasting peace, and into the<br/>glorious company of the saints in light.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
