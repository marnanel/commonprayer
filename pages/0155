<p>Let us pray.</p>
<p>We humbly beseech thee, O Father, mercifully to look upon<br/>our infirmities; and, for the glory of your Name, turn from us<br/>all those evils that we most justly have deserved; and grant<br/>that in all our troubles we may put our whole trust and<br/>confidence in thy mercy, and evermore serve thee in holiness<br/>and pureness of living, to thy honor and glory; through our<br/>only Mediator and Advocate, Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
