<h1>Monday in Holy Week</h1>
<p>Almighty God, whose dear Son went not up to joy but<br/>first he suffered pain, and entered not into glory before he<br/>was crucified:  Mercifully grant that we, walking in the way<br/>of the cross, may find it none other that the way of life and<br/>peace; through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord, who lives<br/>and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever<br/>and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<h1>Tuesday in Holy Week</h1>
<p>O God, by the passion of your blessed Son you made an<br/>instrument of shameful death to be for us the means of life:<br/>Grant us so to glory in the cross of Christ, that we may gladly<br/>suffer shame and loss for the sake of your Son our Savior<br/>Jesus Christ; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy<br/>Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<h1>Wednesday in Holy Week</h1>
<p>Lord God, whose blessed Son our Savior gave his body to be<br/>whipped and his face to be spit upon:  Give us grace to accept<br/>joyfully the sufferings of the present time, confident of the<br/>glory that shall be revealed; through Jesus Christ your Son our<br/>Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one<br/>God, for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
