<h1>In the Morning</h1>
<p><i>From <a href="bible:Psalm+51">Psalm 51</a></i></p>
<p>Open my lips, O Lord, *<br/> and my mouth shall proclaim your praise.</p>
<p>Create in me a clean heart, O God, *<br/> and renew a right spirit within me.</p>
<p>Cast me not away from your presence *<br/> and take not your holy Spirit from me.</p>
<p>Give me the joy of your saving help again *<br/> and sustain me with your bountiful Spirit.</p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br/> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.</p>
