<p>Let us also pray for all who mourn, that they may cast their<br/>care on God, and know the consolation of his love.</p>
<p><i>Silence may be kept; after which the Celebrant says</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, look with pity upon the sorrows of your<br/>servants for whom we pray.  Remember them, Lord, in your mercy;<br/>nourish them with patience; comfort them with a sense of your<br/>goodness; lift up your countenance upon them; and give them<br/>peace; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>If the Burial service is not to follow immediately, the body is then<br/>brought into the church, during which time a suitable psalm or anthem<br/>may be sung or said.  Appropriate devotions, such as those appointed for<br/>the Vigil on page <a href="465.html">465</a>, may follow.</i></p>
<p><i>When the order for the Burial of the Dead follows immediately, the<br/>service continues on page <a href="469.html">469</a> or 491.</i></p>
<p><i>A member of the congregation bearing the lighted Paschal Candle may<br/>lead the procession into the church.</i></p>
