<h1>Concerning the Service</h1>
<p><i>This Order provides a form of evening service or vespers for use on<br/>suitable occasions in the late afternoon or evening.  It may be used as<br/>a complete rite in place of Evening Prayer, or as the introduction to<br/>Evening Prayer or some other service, or as the prelude to an evening<br/>meal or other activity.  It is appropriate also for use in private<br/>houses.</i></p>
<p><i>Any part or parts of this service may be lead by lay persons.  A priest<br/>or deacon, when presiding, should read the Prayer for Light, and the<br/>Blessing or Dismissal at the end.  The bishop, when present, should give<br/>the Blessing.</i></p>
<p><i>This order is not appropriate for use on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday<br/>in Holy Week, or on Good Friday.  Easter Eve has its own form for the<br/>Lighting of the Paschal Candle.</i></p>
