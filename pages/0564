<h1>After Communion</h1>
<p><i>At the Induction of a priest or deacon, in place of the usual<br/>postcommunion prayer, the Bishop leads the people in the following<br/>prayer; but if the new minister is a lay person, the usual postcommunion<br/>prayer is used.</i></p>
<p>Almighty Father, we thank you for feeding us with the holy<br/>food of the Body and Blood of your Son, and for uniting us<br/>through him in the fellowship of your Holy Spirit.  We thank<br/>you for raising up among us faithful servants for the ministry<br/>of your Word and Sacraments.  We pray that <b><span class="person">N</span></b> may be to us<br/>an effective example in word and action, in love and patience,<br/>and in holiness of life.  Grant that we, with <i>him</i>, may serve<br/>you now, and always rejoice in your glory; through Jesus<br/>Christ your Son our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and<br/>the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.  Amen.</p>
<p><i>A newly inducted Priest may, at the bishop's request, pronounce a<br/>blessing.</i></p>
<p><i>A Deacon, or a Priest if no deacon is present, dismisses the assembly.</i></p>
<p><i>Additional Directions</i></p>
