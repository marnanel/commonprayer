<p><i>Celebrant</i>  Will you strive for justice and peace among all people,<br/> and respect the dignity of every human being?</p>
<p><i>People</i> I will, with God's help.</p>
<p><i>The Celebrant concludes the Renewal of Vows as follows</i></p>
<p>May Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who<br/>has given us a new birth by water and the Holy Spirit, and<br/>bestowed upon us the forgiveness of sins, keep us in eternal<br/>life by his grace, in Christ Jesus our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<h1>At the Eucharist</h1>
<p><i>The candles at the Altar may now be lighted from the Paschal Candle.</i></p>
<p><i>One of the following Canticles is then sung.  Immediately before the<br/>Canticle the Celebrant may say to the people</i></p>
<p>Alleluia.  Christ is risen.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  The Lord is risen indeed.  Alleluia.</p>
<p><i>The Canticles</i></p>
<p>Gloria in excelsis</p>
<p>Te Deum laudamus</p>
<p>Pascha nostrum</p>
<p><i>The Celebrant then says</i></p>
<p>The Lord be with you.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  And also with you.</p>
<p><i>Celebrant</i>  Let us pray.</p>
