<p>If I say, "Surely the darkness will cover me, and the light<br/>around me turn to night,"  darkness is not dark to you, O<br/>Lord; the night is as bright as the day; darkness and light to<br/>you are both alike.  <i><a href="bible:Psalm+139%3A10%2C11">Psalm 139:10,11</a></i></p>
<p>Jesus said, "I am the light of the world; whoever follows me<br/>will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."<br/><i><a href="bible:John+8%3A12">John 8:12</a></i></p>
<p><i>The following Confession of Sin may then be said; or the Office may<br/>continue at once with "O God make speed to save us."</i></p>
<h1>Confession of Sin</h1>
<p><i>The Officiant says to the people</i></p>
<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God,<br/>let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts<br/>confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his<br/>infinite goodness and mercy.</p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.</p>
<p><i>Silence may be kept.</i></p>
<p><i>Officiant and People together, all kneeling</i></p>
<p>Most merciful God,<br/>we confess that we have sinned against you<br/>in thought, word, and deed,<br/>by what we have done,<br/>and by what we have left undone.<br/>We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br/>we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br/>We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.</p>
