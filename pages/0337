<p>O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world,<br/>have mercy upon us.</p>
<p>O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world,<br/>grant us thy peace.</p>
<p><i>The following prayer may be said.  The People may join in saying this<br/>prayer</i></p>
<p>We do not presume to come to this thy Table, O merciful<br/>Lord, trusting in our own righteousness, but in thy manifold<br/>and great mercies.  We are not worthy so much as to gather<br/>up the crumbs under thy Table.  But thou art the same Lord<br/>whose property is always to have mercy.  Grant us therefore,<br/>gracious Lord, so to eat the flesh of thy dear Son Jesus Christ,<br/>and to drink his blood, that we may evermore dwell in him,<br/>and he in us.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
