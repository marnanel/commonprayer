<h1>Communion under Special Circumstances</h1>
<p><i>This form is intended for use with those who for reasonable cause<br/>cannot be present at a public celebration of the Eucharist.</i></p>
<p><i>When persons are unable to be present for extended periods, it is<br/>desirable that the priest arrange to celebrate the Eucharist with them<br/>from time to time on a regular basis, using either the Proper of the Day<br/>or one of those appointed for Various Occasions.  If it is necessary to<br/>shorten the service, the priest may begin the celebration at the<br/>Offertory, but it is desirable that a passage from the Gospel first be<br/>read.</i></p>
<p><i>At other times, or when desired, such persons may be communicated from<br/>the reserved Sacrament, using the following form.</i></p>
<p><i>It is desirable that fellow parishoners, relatives, and friends be<br/>present, when possible, to communicate with them.</i></p>
<p><i>The Celebrant, whether priest or deacon, reads a passage of Scripture<br/>appropriate to the day or occasion, or else one of the following</i></p>
<p>God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that<br/>whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.<br/><i><a href="bible:John+3%3A16">John 3:16</a></i></p>
<p>Jesus said, "I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall<br/>not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst."<br/><i><a href="bible:John+6%3A35">John 6:35</a></i></p>
