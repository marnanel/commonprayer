<h1>24. For Vocation in Daily Work</h1>
<p>Almighty God our heavenly Father, you declare your glory<br/>and show forth your handiwork in the heavens and in the<br/>earth:  Deliver us in our various occupations from the service<br/>of self alone, that we may do the work you give us to do in<br/>truth and beauty and for the common good; for the sake of<br/>him who came among us as one who serves, your Son Jesus<br/>Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy<br/>Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<h1>25. For Labor Day</h1>
<p>Almighty God, you have so linked our lives one with another<br/>that all we do affects, for good or ill, all other lives:  So guide<br/>us in the work we do, that we may do it not for self alone, but<br/>for the common good; and, as we seek a proper return for<br/>our own labor, make us mindful of the rightful aspirations of<br/>other workers, and arouse our concern for those who are out<br/>of work; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns<br/>with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>
