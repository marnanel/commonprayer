<p><i>Standing at the door of the church, the Bishop says</i></p>
<p>Let the door(s) be opened.</p>
<p><i>The door is opened.  With the pastoral staff the Bishop marks the<br/>threshold with the sign of the cross saying</i></p>
<p>Peace be to this house, and to all who enter here: + In the<br/>Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>As the procession moves into the church, <a href="bible:Psalm+122">Psalm 122 </a>or some other<br/>appropriate psalm is sung.  Hymns and anthems may also be sung.</i></p>
<p><i>The congregation standing, the Bishop begins the Prayer for the<br/>Consecration of the Church</i></p>
<p>Our help is in the Name of the Lord;</p>
<p><i>People</i>  The maker of heaven and earth.</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>  Let us pray.</p>
<p>Everliving Father, watchful and caring, our source and our<br/>end: All that we are and all that we have is yours.  Accept us<br/>now, as we dedicate this place to which we come to praise<br/>your Name, to ask your forgiveness, to know your healing<br/>power, to hear your Word, and to be nourished by the Body<br/>and Blood of your Son.  Be present always to guide and to<br/>judge, to illuminate and to bless your people.</p>
<p><i>A Warden or other representative of the congregation continues</i></p>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, make this a temple of your presence and a<br/>house of prayer.  Be always near us when we seek you in this<br/>place.  Draw us to you, when we come alone and when we<br/>come with others, to find comfort and wisdom, to be supported<br/>and strengthened, to rejoice and give thanks.  May it be here,<br/>Lord Christ, that we are made one with you and with one</p>
