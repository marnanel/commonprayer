<p>O God, who before the passion of your only-begotten Son<br/>revealed his glory upon the holy mountain:  Grant to us that<br/>we, beholding by faith the light of his countenance, may be<br/>strengthened to bear our cross, and be changed into his<br/>likeness from glory to glory; through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br/>who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God,<br/>for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p>Almighty and everlasting God, you hate nothing you have<br/>made and forgive the sins of all who are penitent:  Create and<br/>make in us new and contrite hearts, that we, worthily<br/>lamenting our sins and acknowledging our wretchedness,<br/>may obtain of you, the God of all mercy, perfect remission<br/>and forgiveness; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives<br/>and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever<br/>and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
