<p>into our hearts that most excellent gift of charity, the very<br/>bond of peace and of all virtue, without which whosoever<br/>liveth is counted dead before thee.  Grant this for thine only<br/>Son Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth with thee<br/>and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<h1>Eighth Sunday after the Epiphany</h1>
<p>Most loving Father, who willest us to give thanks for all<br/>things, to dread nothing but the loss of thee, and to cast all<br/>our care on thee who carest for us:  Preserve us from faithless<br/>fears and worldly anxieties, ang grant that no clouds of this<br/>mortal life may hide from us the light of that love which is<br/>immortal, and which thou hast manifested to us in thy Son<br/>Jesus Christ our Lord; who liveth and reigneth with thee, in<br/>the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>

<h1>Last Sunday after the Epiphany</h1>
<p><i>This Proper is always used on the Sunday before Ash Wednesday</i></p>
<p>O God, who before the passion of thy only-begotten Son<br/>didst reveal his glory upon the holy mount:  Grant unto us<br/>that we, beholding by faith the light of his countenance, may<br/>be strengthened to bear our cross, and be changed into his<br/>likeness from glory to glory; through Jesus Christ<br/>our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy<br/>Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
