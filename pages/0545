<p><i>The Bishop then says this Prayer of Consecration</i></p>
<p>O God, most merciful Father, we praise you for sending your<br/>Son Jesus Christ, who took on himself the form of a servant,<br/>and humbled himself, becoming obedient even to death on<br/>the cross.  We praise you that you have highly exalted him,<br/>and made him Lord of all; and that, through him, we know<br/>that whoever would be great must be servant of all.  We praise<br/>you for the many ministries in your Church, and for calling<br/>this your servant to the order of deacons.</p>
<p><i>Here the Bishop lays hands upon the head of the ordinand, and prays</i></p>
<p>Therefore, Father, through Jesus Christ your Son, give your<br/>Holy Spirit to <b><span class="person">N</span></b>; fill him with grace and power, and make<br/>him a deacon in your Church.</p>
<p><i>The Bishop continues</i></p>
<p>Make <i>him</i>, O Lord, modest and humble, strong and constant,<br/>to observe the discipline of Christ.  Let <i>his</i> life and teaching so<br/>reflect your commandments, that through <i>him</i> many may<br/>come to know you and love you.  As your Son came not to be<br/>served but to serve, may this deacon share in Christ's service,<br/>and come to the unending glory of him who, with you and<br/>the Holy Spirit, lives and reigns, one God, for ever and ever.</p>
<p><i>The People in a loud voice respond</i>  Amen.</p>
<p><i>The new deacon is now vested according to the order of deacons.</i></p>
<p><i>The Bishop then gives a Bible to the newly ordained, saying</i></p>
<p>Receive this Bible as the sign of your authority to proclaim<br/>God's Word and to assist in the ministration of his holy<br/>Sacraments.</p>
