<p><i>The Bishop goes to the pulpit, lays a hand upon it, and says</i></p>
<p>Father, in every age you have spoken through the voices of<br/>prophets, pastors, and teachers.  Purify the lives and the lips<br/>of those who speak here, that your word only may be<br/>proclaimed, and your word only may be heard.</p>
<p><b><span class="person">V</span></b>  Your word is a lantern to our feet,</p>
<p><b><span class="person">R</span></b>  And a light upon our path.</p>
<p>We dedicate this Pulpit in the Name of the Father, and of the<br/>Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</p>
