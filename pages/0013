<h1>Concerning the Service<br/>of the Church</h1>
<p>The Holy Eucharist, the principal act of Christian worship on the Lord's<br/>Day and other major Feasts, and Daily Morning and Evening Prayer, as<br/>set forth in this Book, are the regular services appointed for public<br/>worship in the Church.</p>
<p>In addition to these services and the other rites contained in this<br/>Book, other forms set forth by authority within this Church may be used.<br/>Also, subject to the direction of the bishop, special devotions taken<br/>from this Book, or from Holy Scripture, may be used when the needs of<br/>the  congregation so require.</p>
<p>For special days of thanksgiving, appointed by civil or Church<br/>authority, and for other special occasions for which no service or<br/>prayer has been provided in this Book, the bishop may set forth such<br/>forms as are fitting to the occasion.</p>
<p>In all services, the entire Christian assembly participates in such a<br/>way that the members of each order within the Church, lay persons,<br/>bishops, priests, and deacons, fulfull the functions proper to their<br/>respective orders, as set forth in the rubrical directions for each<br/>service.</p>
<p>The leader of worship in a Christian assembly is normally a bishop or<br/>priest.  Deacons by virtue of their order do not exercise a presiding<br/>function; but, like lay persons, may officiate in the Liturgy of the<br/>Word, whether in the form provided in the Daily Office, or (when a<br/>bishop or priest is not present) in the form appointed at the Eucharist.<br/>Under exceptional circumstances, when the services of a priest cannot be<br/>obtained, the bishop may, at discretion, authorize a deacon to preside</p>
