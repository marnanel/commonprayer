<p>Examine your lives and conduct by the rule of God's<br/>commandments, that you may perceive wherein you have<br/>offended in what you have done or left undone, whether in<br/>thought, word, or deed.  And acknowledge your sins before<br/>Almighty God, with full purpose of amendment of life, being<br/>ready to make restitution for all injuries and wrongs done by<br/>you to others; and also being ready to forgive those who have<br/>offended you, in order that you yourselves may be forgiven.<br/>And then, being reconciled with one another, come to the<br/>banquet of that most heavenly Food.</p>
<p>And if, in your preparation, you need help and counsel, then<br/>go and open your grief to a discreet and understanding priest,<br/>and confess your sins, that you may receive the benefit of<br/>absolution, and spiritual counsel and advice; to the removal<br/>of scruple and doubt, the assurance of pardon, and the<br/>strengthening of your faith.</p>
<p>To Christ our Lord who loves us, and washed us in his own<br/>blood, and made us a kingdom of priests to serve his God<br/>and Father, to him be glory in the Church evermore.  Through<br/>him let us offer continually the sacrifice of praise, which is<br/>our bounden duty and service, and, with faith in him, come<br/>boldly before the throne of grace [and humbly confess our<br/>sins to Almighty God].</p>

<p>God spake these words, and said:<br/>I am the Lord thy God who brought thee out of the land of<br/>Egypt, out of the house of bondage.  Thou shalt have none<br/>other gods but me.<br/><i>Lord have mercy upon us,<br/>and incline our hearts to keep this law.</i></p>
