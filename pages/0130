<p>3  He shall deliver you from the snare of the hunter *<br/> and from the deadly pestilence.</p>
<p>4  he shall cover you with his pinions,<br/>and you shall find refuge under his wings; *<br/> his faithfulness shall be a shield and buckler.</p>
<p>5  You shall not be afraid of any terror by night, *<br/> nor of the arrow that flies by day;</p>
<p>6  Of the plague that stalks in the darkness, *<br/> nor of the sickness that lays waste at mid-day.</p>
<p>7  A thousand shall fall at your side<br/>and ten thousand at your right hand, *<br/> but it shall not come near you.</p>
<p>8  Your eyes only have to behold *<br/> to see the reward of the wicked.</p>
<p>9  Because you have made the LORD your refuge, *<br/> and the Most High your habitation,</p>
<p>10  There shall no evil happen to you, *<br/> neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.</p>
<p>11  For he shall give his angels charge over you, *<br/> to keep you in all your ways.</p>
<p>12  They shall bear you in their hands, *<br/> lest you dash your foot against a stone.</p>
<p>13  You shall tread upon the lion and the adder; *<br/> you shall trample the young lion and the serpent<br/>  under your feet.</p>
<p>14  Because he is bound to me in love,<br/>therefore will I deliver him; *<br/> I will protect him, because he knows my Name.</p>
