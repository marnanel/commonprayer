<h1>General Thanksgivings</h1>
<p><i>1.  A General Thanksgiving</i></p>
<p>Accept, O Lord, our thanks and praise for all that you have<br/>done for us.  We thank you for the splendor of the whole<br/>creation, for the beauty of this world, for the wonder of life,<br/>and for the mystery of love.</p>
<p>We thank you for the blessing of family and friends, and for<br/>the loving care which surrounds us on every side.</p>
<p>We thank you for setting us at tasks which demand our best<br/>efforts, and for leading us to accomplishments which satisfy<br/>and delight us.</p>
<p>We thank you also for those disappointments and failures<br/>that lead us to acknowledge our dependence on you alone.</p>
<p>Above all, we thank you for your Son Jesus Christ; for the<br/>truth of his Word and the example of his life; for his steadfast<br/>obedience, by which he overcame temptation; for his dying,<br/>through which he overcame death; and for his rising to life<br/>again, in which we are raised to the life of your kingdom.</p>
<p>Grant us the gift of your Spirit, that we may know him and<br/>make him known; and through him, at all times and in all<br/>places, may give thanks to you in all things.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
