<h1>The Marriage</h1>
<p><i>The Man, facing the woman and taking her right hand in his, says</i></p>
<p>In the Name of God, I, <b><span class="person">N</span></b>, take you, <b><span class="person">N</span></b>, to be my wife, to<br/>have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse,<br/>for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to<br/>cherish, until we are parted by death.  This is my solemn vow.</p>
<p><i>Then they loose their hands, and the Woman, still facing the man, takes<br/>his right hand in hers, and says</i></p>
<p>In the Name of God, I, <b><span class="person">N</span></b>, take you, <b><span class="person">N</span></b>, to be my husband,<br/>to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse,<br/>for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to<br/>cherish, until we are parted by death.  This is my solemn vow.</p>
<p><i>The loose their hands.</i></p>
<p><i>The Priest may ask God's blessing on a ring or rings as follows</i></p>
<p>Bless, O Lord, <i>this ring</i> to be <i>a sign</i> of the vows by which<br/>this man and this woman have bound themselves to each<br/>other; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>The giver places the ring on the ring-finger of the other's hand and<br/>says</i></p>
<p><b><span class="person">N</span></b>, I give you this ring as a symbol of my vow, and with all<br/>that I am, and all that I have, I honor you, in the Name of<br/>the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit (<i>or</i> in the<br/>Name of God).</p>
