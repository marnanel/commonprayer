<p><i>A Collect for Sundays</i></p>
<p>O God, who makest us glad with the weekly remembrance of<br/>the glorious resurrection of thy Son our Lord:  Grant us this<br/>day such blessing through our worship of thee, that the days<br/>to come may be spent in thy favor; through Jesus<br/>Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>A Collect for Fridays</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, whose most dear Son went not up to joy but<br/>first he suffered pain, and entered not into glory before he<br/>was crucified:  Mercifully grant that we, walking in the way<br/>of the cross, may find it none other than the way of life and<br/>peace; through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>A Collect for Saturdays</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, who after the creation of the world didst rest<br/>from all thy works and sanctify a day of rest for all thy<br/>creatures:  Grant that we, putting away all earthly anxieties,<br/>may be duly prepared for the service of thy sanctuary, and<br/>that our rest here upon earth may be a preparation for the<br/>eternal rest promised to thy people in heaven; through Jesus<br/>Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>A Collect for the Renewal of Life</i></p>
<p>O God, the King eternal, who dividest the day from the<br/>night and turnest the shadow of death into the morning:<br/>Drive far from us all wrong desires, incline our hearts to keep<br/>thy law, and guide our feet into the way of peace; that,<br/>having done thy will with cheerfulness while it was day, we<br/>may, when night cometh, rejoice to give thee thanks;<br/>through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
