<p>Jesus said, "I am the living bread which came down from<br/>heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and<br/>the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my<br/>flesh.  For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink<br/>indeed.  Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in<br/>me, and I in him."  <i><a href="bible:John+6%3A51%2C55-56">John 6:51, 55-56</a></i></p>
<p>Jesus said, "Abide in me, as I in you.  As the branch cannot<br/>bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can<br/>you, unless you abide in me.  I am the vine, you are the<br/>branches.  By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much<br/>fruit, and so prove to be my disciples.  As the Father has loved<br/>me, so have I loved you; abide in my love."  <i><a href="bible:John+15%3A4-5">John 15:4-5</a>a, 8-9</i></p>
