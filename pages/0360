<p><i>The Deacon or Celebrant says</i></p>
<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.</p>
<p><i>Silence may be kept.</i></p>
<p><i>Minister and People</i></p>
<p>Most merciful God,<br/>we confess that we have sinned against you<br/>in thought, word, and deed,<br/>by what we have done,<br/>and by what we have left undone.<br/>We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br/>we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves. We are truly sorry and we<br/>humbly repent. For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br/>have mercy on us and forgive us;<br/>that we may delight in your will,<br/>and walk in your ways,<br/>to the glory of your Name.  Amen.</p>
<p><i>The Bishop, when present, or the Priest, stands and says</i></p>
<p>Almighty God have mercy on you, forgive you all your sins<br/>through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen you in all<br/>goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep you in<br/>eternal life.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<h1>The Peace</h1>
<p><i>All stand.  The Celebrant says to the people</i></p>
<p>The peace of the Lord be always with you.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  And also with you.</p>
<p><i>Then the Ministers and People may greet one another in the name of the<br/>Lord.</i></p>
