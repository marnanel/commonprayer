<p>Father, you loved the world so much that in the fullness of<br/>time you sent your only Son to be our Savior.  Incarnate by<br/>the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, he lived as one of<br/>us, yet without sin.  To the poor he proclaimed the good news<br/>of salvation; to prisoners, freedom; to the sorrowful, joy.  To<br/>fulfill your purpose he gave himself up to death; and, rising<br/>from the grave, destroyed death, and made the whole<br/>creation new.</p>
<p>And, that we might live no longer for ourselves, but for him<br/>who died and rose for us, he sent the Holy Spirit, his own<br/>first gift for those who believe, to complete his work in<br/>the world, and to bring to fulfillment the sanctification of all.</p>
<p><i>At the following words concerning the bread, the Celebrant is to hold<br/>it, or lay a hand upon it, and at the words concerning the cup, to hold<br/>or place a hand upon the cup and any other vessel containing wine to be<br/>consecrated.</i></p>
<p>When the hour had come for him to be glorified by you, his<br/>heavenly Father, having loved his own who were in the<br/>world, he loved them to the end; at supper with them he took<br/>bread, and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and<br/>gave it to his disciples, and said, "Take, eat: This is my Body,<br/>which is given for you.  Do this for the remembrance of me."</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given<br/>thanks, he gave it to them, and said, "Drink this, all of you:<br/>This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you<br/>and for many for the forgiveness of sins.  Whenever you drink<br/>it, do this for the remembrance of me."</p>
<p>Father, we now celebrate this memorial of our redemption.<br/>Recalling Christ's death and his descent among the dead,<br/>proclaiming his resurrection and ascension to your right<br/>hand, awaiting his coming in glory; and offering to you, from<br/>the gifts you have given us, this bread and this cup, we praise<br/>you and we bless you.</p>
