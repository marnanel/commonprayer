<p><i>Holy Baptism (beginning with the Presentation of the Candidates,<br/>page <a href="305.html">305</a>, and concluding with the reception of the newly baptized) may<br/>be administered here or after the Gospel.  Confirmation may also be<br/>administered.</i></p>
<p><i>The Celebrant may first address the people in these or similar words,<br/>all standing</i></p>
<p>Through the Paschal mystery, dear friends, we are buried<br/>with Christ by Baptism into his death, and raised with him to<br/>newness of life.  I call upon you, therefore, now that our<br/>Lenten observance is ended, to renew the solemn promises<br/>and vows of Holy Baptism, by which we once renounced<br/>Satan and all his works, and promised to serve God faithfully<br/>in his holy Catholic Church.</p>
<h1>The Renewal of Baptismal Vows</h1>
<p><i>Celebrant</i>  Do you reaffirm your renunciation of evil and<br/>renew your commitment to Jesus Christ?</p>
<p><i>People</i>  I do.</p>
<p><i>Celebrant</i>  Do you believe in God the Father?</p>
<p><i>People</i>  I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and<br/>earth.</p>
