<p>weighty cause could not be present at the celebration, or for the<br/>administration of Communion by a deacon to a congregation when no priest<br/>is available, the celebrant or deacon, and other communicants,<br/>reverently eat and drink it, either after the Communion of the people or<br/>after the Dismissal.*</p>
<p><i>A hymn may be sung before or after the postcommunion prayer.</i></p>
<p><i>Disciplinary Rubrics</i></p>
<p><i>If the priest knows that a person who is living a notoriously evil life<br/>intends to come to Communion, the priest shall speak to that person<br/>privately, and tell <i>him</i> that <i>he</i> may not come to the Holy Table until<br/><i>he</i> has given clear proof of repentance and amendment of life.</i></p>
<p><i>The priest shall follow the same procedure with those who have done<br/>wrong to their neighbors and are a scandal to the other members of the<br/>congregation, not allowing such persons to receive Communion until they<br/>have made restitution for the wrong they have done, or have at least<br/>promised to do so.</i></p>
<p><i>When the priest sees that there is hatred between members of the<br/>congregation, <i>he</i> shall speak privately to them, telling them that they<br/>may not receive Communion until they have forgiven each other. And if<br/>the person or persons on one side truly forgive the others and desire<br/>and promise to make up for their faults, but those on the other side<br/>refuse to forgive, the priest shall allow those who are penitent to come<br/>to Communion, but not those who are stubborn.</i></p>
<p><i>In all such cases, the priest is required to notify the bishop, within<br/>fourteen days at the most, giving the reasons for refusing Communion.</i></p>
