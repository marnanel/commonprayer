<p>O gracious and everliving God, you have created us male and<br/>female in your image: Look mercifully upon this man and this<br/>woman who come to you seeking your blessing, and assist<br/>them with your grace, that with true fidelity and steadfast love<br/>they may honor and keep the promises and vows they make;<br/>through Jesus Christ our Savior, who lives and reigns with<br/>you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>
