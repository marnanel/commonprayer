<h1>Saint Stephen</h1>  <i>December 26</i>
<p>We give the thanks, O Lord of glory, for the example of the<br/>first martyr Stephen, who looked up to heaven and prayed<br/>for his persecutors to thy Son Jesus Christ, who standeth at<br/>thy right hand; where he liveth and reigneth with thee and<br/>the Holy Spirit, one God, in glory everlasting.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<h1>Saint John</h1>  <i>December 27</i>
<p>Shed upon thy Church, we beseech thee, O Lord, the<br/>brightness of thy light, that we, being illumined by the<br/>teaching of thine apostle and evangelist John, may so walk<br/>in the light of thy truth, that at length we may attain to the<br/>fullness of eternal life; through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br/>who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, one<br/>God, for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<h1>The Holy Innocents</h1>  <i>December 28</i>
<p>We remember today, O God, the slaughter of the holy<br/>innocents of Bethlehem by the order of King Herod.  Receive,<br/>we beseech thee, into the arms of thy mercy all innocent<br/>victims; and by thy great might frustrate the designs of evil<br/>tyrants and establish thy rule of justice, love, and peace;<br/>through Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with<br/>thee, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,, one God, for ever and<br/>ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
