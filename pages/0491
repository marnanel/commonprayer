<h1>The Burial of the Dead:<br/>Rite Two</h1>
<p><i>All stand while one or more of the following anthems is sung or said. A<br/>hymn, psalm, or some other suitable anthem may be sung instead.</i></p>
<p>I am Resurrection and I am Life, says the Lord.<br/>Whoever has faith in me shall have life,<br/>even though he die.<br/>And everyone who has life,<br/>and has committed himself to me in faith,<br/>shall not die for ever.</p>
<p>As for me, I know that my Redeemer lives<br/>and that at the last he will stand upon the earth.<br/>After my awaking, he will raise me up;<br/>and in my body I shall see God.<br/>I myself shall see, and my eyes behold him<br/>who is my friend and not a stranger.</p>
<p>For none of us has life in himself,<br/>and none becomes his own master when he dies.<br/>For if we have life, we are alive in the Lord,<br/>and if we die, we die in the Lord.<br/>So, then, whether we live or die,<br/>we are the Lord's possession.</p>
