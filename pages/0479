<p>Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, *<br/> therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.</p>
<p>The snares of death compassed me round about, *<br/> and the pains of hell gat hold upon me.</p>
<p>I found trouble and heaviness;<br/>then called I upon the Name of the LORD; *<br/> O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.</p>
<p>Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; *<br/> yea, our God is merciful.</p>
<p>The LORD preserveth the simple; *<br/> I was in misery, and he helped me.</p>
<p>Turn again then unto thy rest, O my soul, *<br/> for the LORD hath rewarded thee.</p>
<p>And why?  thou hast delivered my soul from death, *<br/> mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.</p>
<p>I will walk before the LORD *<br/> in the land of the living.</p>
<p>I will pay my vows now in the presence of all his people; *<br/> right dear in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.</p>
