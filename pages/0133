<p><i>Officiant</i>  Lord, hear our prayer;</p>
<p><i>People</i>  And let our cry come to you.</p>
<p><i>Officiant</i>  Let us pray.</p>
<p><i>The Officiant then says one of the following Collects</i></p>
<p>Be our light in the darkness, O Lord, and in your great mercy<br/>defend us from all perils and dangers of this night; for the<br/>love of your only Son, our Savior Jesus Christ.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>Be present, O merciful God, and protect us through the hours<br/>of this night, so that we who are wearied by the changes and<br/>chances of this life may rest in your eternal changelessness;<br/>through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>Look down, O Lord, from your heavenly throne, and<br/>illumine this night with your celestial brightness; that by<br/>night as by day your people may glorify your holy Name;<br/>through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>Visit this place, O Lord, and drive far from it all snare of the<br/>enemy; let your holy angels dwell with us to preserve us in<br/>peace; and let your blessing be upon us always; through Jesus<br/>Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
