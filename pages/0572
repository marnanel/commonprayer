<p><i>When an instrument of music is to be dedicated, after the Epistle the<br/>Bishop proceeds to an appropriate place, and says</i></p>
<p>Father, your people worship you with many voices and<br/>sounds, in times of joy and sorrow.  Move us to express the<br/>wonder, the power, and the glory of your creation in the<br/>music we make and in the songs we sing.</p>
<p><b><span class="person">V</span></b>  Praise him with the sound of the trumpet;</p>
<p><b><span class="person">R</span></b>  Praise him with strings and pipe.</p>
<p>We dedicate this (<i>name of instrument</i>) in the Name of the<br/>Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>Instrumental music is now played, or a hymn or anthem sung.</i></p>
<p><i>All then stand for the Gospel, which may be the following</i></p>
<p><a href="bible:Matthew+7%3A13-14%2C24-25">Matthew 7:13-14,24-25</a>, <i>or</i> <a href="bible:Matthew+21%3A10-14">Matthew 21:10-14</a></p>
<p><i>Sermon or Address</i></p>
<p><i>Other Pastoral Offices may follow.</i></p>
<p><i>If the Apostles' Creed has not already been said, the Nicene Creed is<br/>now said or sung.</i></p>
<p><i>The Deacon or a member of the congregation leads the Prayers of the<br/>People.</i></p>
<p><i>After a period of silence, the Bishop concludes with the following<br/>prayers</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, all times are your seasons, and all occasions<br/>invite your tender mercies: Accept our prayers and<br/>intercessions offered in this place today and in the days to<br/>come; through Jesus Christ, our Mediator and Advocate.<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>
