<p><i>A Collect for Grace</i></p>
<p>Lord God, almighty and everlasting Father, you have<br/>brought us in safety to this new day:  Preserve us with your<br/>mighty power, that we may not fall into sin, nor be overcome<br/>by adversity; and in all we do, direct us to the fulfilling of<br/>your purpose; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>A Collect for Guidance</i></p>
<p>Heavenly Father, in you we live and move and have our<br/>being:  We humbly pray you so to guide and govern us by<br/>your Holy Spirit, that in all the cares and occupations of our<br/>life we may not forget you, but may remember that we are<br/>ever walking in your sight; through Jesus Christ our Lord.<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>Then, unless the Eucharist or a form of general intercession is to<br/>follow, one of these prayer for mission is added</i></p>
<p>Almighty and everlasting God, by whose Spirit the whole<br/>body of your faithful people is governed and sanctified:<br/>Receive our supplications and prayers which we offer before<br/>your for all members of you holy Church, that in their<br/>vocation and ministry they may truly and devoutly serve you;<br/>through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>O God, you have made of one blood all the peoples of the<br/>earth, and sent your blessed Son to preach peace to those<br/>who are far off and to those who are near:  Grant that people<br/>everywhere may seek after you and find you; bring the<br/>nations into your fold; pour out your Spirit upon all flesh,<br/>and hasten the coming of your kingdom; through Jesus<br/>Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
