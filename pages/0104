<p>107  I am deeply troubled; *<br/> preserve my life, O Lord, according to your word.</p>
<p>108  Accept, O LORD, the willing tribute of my lips, *<br/> and teach me your judgments.</p>
<p>109  My life is always in my hand, *<br/> yet I do not forget your law.</p>
<p>110  The wicked have set a trap for me, *<br/> but I have not strayed from your commandments.</p>
<p>111  Your decrees are my inheritance for ever; *<br/> truly, they are the joy of my heart.</p>
<p>112  I have applied my heart to fulfill your statues *<br/> for ever and to the end.</p>
<h1><a href="bible:Psalm+121">Psalm 121</a></h1>  <i>Levavi oculos</i>
<p>1  I lift up my eyes to the hills; *<br/> from where is my help to come?</p>
<p>2  My help comes from the LORD, *<br/> the maker of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>3  He will not let your foot be moved *<br/> and he who watches over you will not fall asleep.</p>
<p>4  Behold, he who keeps watch over Israel *<br/> shall neither slumber nor sleep;</p>
<p>5  The LORD himself watches over you; *<br/> the LORD is your shade at your right hand,</p>
<p>6  So that the sun shall not strike you by day, *<br/> nor the moon by night.</p>
<p>7  The LORD shall preserve you from all evil; *<br/> it is he who shall keep you safe.</p>
