<p><i>65.  For the Answering of Prayer</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, who hast promised to hear the petitions of<br/>those who ask in thy Son's Name:  We beseech thee mercifully<br/>to incline thine ear to us who have now made our prayers and<br/>supplications unto thee; and grant that those things which we<br/>have faithfully asked according to thy will, may effectually be<br/>obtained, to the relief of our necessity, and to the setting forth<br/>of thy glory; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p>Be present, be present, O Jesus, our great High Priest, as you<br/>were present with your disciples, and be know to us in the<br/>breaking of bread; who live and reign with the Father and<br/>the Holy Spirit, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>67.  After Receiving Communion</i></p>
<p>O Lord Jesus Christ, who in a wonderful Sacrament hast left<br/>unto us a memorial of thy passion:  Grant us, we beseech<br/>thee, so to venerate the sacred mysteries of thy Body and<br/>Blood, that we may ever perceive within ourselves the fruit of<br/>thy redemption; who livest and reignest with the Father and<br/>the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>68.  After Worship</i></p>
<p>Grant, we beseech <i>thee</i>, Almighty God, that the words which<br/>we have heard this day with our outward ears, may, through<br/><i>thy</i> grace, be so grafted inwardly in our hearts, that they may<br/>bring forth in us the fruit of good living, to the honor and<br/>praise of <i>thy</i> Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
