<p><i>The Celebrant then addresses the congregation, saying</i></p>
<p>Will you who have witnessed these promises do all in your<br/>power to uphold these two persons in their marriage?</p>
<p><i>People</i>  We will.</p>
<p><i>If a ring or rings are to be blessed, the wife extends her hand (and<br/>the husband extends his hand) toward the Priest, who says</i></p>
<p>Bless, O Lord, <i>this ring</i> to be <i>a sign</i> of the vows by which<br/>this man and this woman have bound themselves to each<br/>other; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>The Celebrant joins the right hands of the husband and wife and says<br/>Those whom God has joined together let no one put asunder.</i></p>
<p><i>The Congregation responds</i>  Amen.</p>
<p><i>The service continues with The Prayers on page <a href="428.html">428</a>.</i></p>
