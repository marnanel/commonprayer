<h1>Concerning the Service</h1>
<p><i>Holy Baptism is full initiation by water and the Holy Spirit into<br/>Christ's Body the Church.  The bond which God establishes in Baptism<br/>is indissoluble.</i></p>
<p><i>Holy Baptism is appropriately administered within the Eucharist as the<br/>chief service on a Sunday or other feast.</i></p>
<p><i>The bishop, when present, is the celebrant; and is expected to preach<br/>the Word and preside at Baptism and the Eucharist.  At Baptism, the<br/>bishop officiates at the Presentation and Examination of Candidates;<br/>says the Thanksgiving over the Water; [consecrates the Chrism;] reads<br/>the prayer, "Heavenly Father, we thank you that by water and the Holy<br/>Spirit;" and officiates at what follows.</i></p>
<p><i>In the absence of a bishop, a priest is the celebrant and presides at<br/>the service.  If a priest uses Chrism in signing the newly baptized, it<br/>must have been previously consecrated by the bishop.</i></p>
<p><i>Each candidate for Holy Baptism is to be sponsored by one or more<br/>baptized persons.</i></p>
<p><i>Sponsors of adults and older children present their candidates and<br/>thereby signify their endorsement of the candidates and their intention<br/>to support them by prayer and example in their Christian life.  Sponsors<br/>of infants, commonly called godparents, present their candidates, make<br/>promises in their own names, and also take vows on behalf of their<br/>candidates.</i></p>
<p><i>It is fitting that parents be included among the godparents of their<br/>own children.  Parents and godparents are to be instructed in the<br/>meaning of Baptism, in their duties to help the new Christians grow in<br/>the knowledge and love of God, and in their responsibilities as members<br/>of his Church.</i></p>
