<h1><a href="bible:Psalm+42">Psalm 42</a></h1>  <i>Quemadmodum</i>
<p>Like as the hart desireth the water-brooks, *<br/> so longeth my soul after thee, O God.</p>
<p>My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God; *<br/> when shall I come to appear before the presence of God?</p>
<p>My tears have been my meat day and night, *<br/> while they daily say unto me, Where is now thy God?</p>
<p>Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself; *<br/> for I went with the multitude, and brought them forth into<br/>  the house of God;</p>
<p>Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul? *<br/> and why art thou so disquieted within me?</p>
<p>O put thy trust in God; *<br/> for I will yet thank him, which is the help of my<br/>  countenance, and my God.</p>
<h1><a href="bible:Psalm+46">Psalm 46</a></h1>  <i>Deus noster refugium</i>
<p>God is our hope and strength, *<br/> a very present help in trouble.</p>
<p>Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be moved, *<br/> and though the hills be carried into the midst of the sea;</p>
<p>Though the waters thereof rage and swell, *<br/> and though the mountains shake at the tempest of the same.</p>
<p>There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God, *<br/> the holy place of the tabernacle of the Most Highest.</p>
