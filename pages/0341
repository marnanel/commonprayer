<p><i>Then, facing the Holy Table, the Celbrant proceeds</i></p>
<p>It is very mee, right, and our bounden duty, that we should<br/>at all times, and in all places, give thanks unto thee, O Lord,<br/>holy Father, almighty, everlasting God.</p>
<p><i>Here a Proper Preface is sung or said on all Sundays, and on other<br/>occasions as appointed.</i></p>
<p>Therefore with Angels and Archangels, and with all the<br/>company of heaven, we laud and magnify thy glorious<br/>Name; evermore praising thee, and saying,</p>
<p><i>Celebrant and People</i></p>
<p>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts:<br/>Heaven and earth are full of thy glory.<br/>Glory be to thee, O Lord Most High.</p>
<p><i>Here may be added</i></p>
<p>Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.<br/>Hosanna in the highest.</p>
<p><i>The people kneel or stand.</i></p>
<p><i>Then the Celebrant continues</i></p>
<p>All glory be to thee, O Lord our God, for that thou didst<br/>create heaven and earth, and didst make us in thine own<br/>image; and, of thy tender mercy, didst give thine only Son<br/>Jesus Christ to take our nature upon him, and to suffer death<br/>upon the cross for our redemption.  He made there a full and<br/>perfect sacrifice for the whole world; and did institute, and in<br/>his holy Gospel command us to continue, a perpetual<br/>memory of that his precious death and sacrifice, until his<br/>coming again.</p>
