<p>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth;<br/> Heaven and earth are full of the majesty of thy glory.</p>
<p>The glorious company of the apostles praise thee.<br/>The goodly fellowship of the prophets praise thee.<br/>The noble army of martyrs praise thee.<br/>The holy Church throughout all the world<br/>  doth acknowledge thee,<br/> the Father, of an infinite majesty,<br/> thine adorable, true, and only Son,<br/> also the Holy Ghost the Comforter.</p>
<p>Thou art the King of glory, O Christ.<br/>Thou art the everlasting Son of the Father.<br/>When thou tookest upon thee to deliver man,<br/>thou didst humble thyself to be born of a Virgin.<br/>When thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death,<br/>thou didst open the kingdom of heaven to all believers.<br/>Thou sittest at the right hand of God, in the glory of the Father.<br/>We believe that thou shalt come to be our judge.<br/> We therefore pray thee, help thy servants,<br/> whom thou hast redeemed with thy precious blood.<br/> Make them to be numbered with thy saints,<br/> in glory everlasting.</p>
<h1>The Apostles' Creed</h1>
<p><i>Officiant and People together, all standing</i></p>
<p>I believe in God, the Father almighty,<br/> maker of heaven and earth;</p>
<p>And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord;<br/> who was conceived by the Holy Ghost,<br/> born of the Virgin Mary,<br/> suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br/> was crucified, dead, and buried.<br/> He descended into hell.</p>
