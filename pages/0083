<p>Know this:  The Lord himself is God; *<br/> he himself has made us, and we are his;<br/> we are his people and the sheep of his pasture.</p>
<p>Enter his gates with thanksgiving;<br/>go into his courts with praise; *<br/> give thanks to him and call upon his Name.</p>
<p>For the Lord is good;<br/>his mercy is everlasting; *<br/> and his faithfulness endures from age to age.</p>
<p><i>In Easter Week, in place of an Invitatory Psalm, the following is sung<br/>or said.  It may also be used daily until the Day of Pentecost.</i></p>
<h1>Christ our Passover</h1>  <i>Pascha nostrum</i>
<p><i><a href="bible:1+Corinthians+5%3A7-8">1 Corinthians 5:7-8</a>; <a href="bible:Romans+6%3A9-11">Romans 6:9-11</a>; <a href="bible:1+Corinthians+15%3A20-22">1 Corinthians 15:20-22</a></i></p>
<p>Alleluia.<br/>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *<br/> therfore let us keep the feast,</p>
<p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *<br/> but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.  Alleluia.</p>
<p>Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *<br/> death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
<p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *<br/> but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
<p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *<br/> and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord.  Alleluia.</p>
<p>Christ has been raised from the dead, *<br/> the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
<p>For since by a man came death, *<br/> by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
<p>For as in Adam all die, *<br/> so also in Christ shall all be made alive.  Alleluia.</p>
