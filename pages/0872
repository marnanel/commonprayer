<h1>XXI.  Of the Authority of General Councils.</h1>
<p>[The Twenty-first of the former Articles is omitted; because it is<br/>partly of a local and civil nature, and is provided for, as to the<br/>remaining parts of it, in other Articles.]</p>
<p><i>The original 1571, 1662 text of this Article, omitted in the version of<br/>1801, reads as follows: "General Councils may not be gathered together<br/>without the commandment and will of Princes.  And when they be gathered<br/>together, (forasmuch as they be an assembly of men, whereof all be not<br/>governed with the Spirit and Word of God,) they may err, and sometimes<br/>have erred, even in things pertaining unto God.  Wherefore things<br/>ordained by them as necessary to salvation have neither strength nor<br/>authority, unless it may be declared that they be taken out of holy<br/>Scripture."</i></p>
<h1>XXII.  Of Purgatory.</h1>
<p>The Romish Doctrine concerning Purgatory, Pardons, Worshipping and<br/>Adoration, as well of Images as of Relics, and also Invocation of<br/>Saints, is a fond thing, vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty<br/>of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God.</p>
<h1>XXIII.  Of Ministering in the Congregation</h1>
<p>It is not lawful for any man to take upon him the office of public<br/>preaching, or ministering the Sacraments in the Congregation, before he<br/>be lawfully called, and sent to execute the same.  And those we ought to<br/>judge lawfully called and sent, which be chosen and called to this work<br/>by men who have public authority given unto them in the Congregation, to<br/>call and send Ministers into the Lord's vineyard.</p>
<h1>XXIV.  Of Speaking in the Congregation in such a Tongue as the people<br/>understandeth.</h1>
<p>It is a thing plainly repugnant to the Word of God, and the custom of<br/>the Primitive Church, to have public Prayer in the Church, or to<br/>minister the Sacraments, in a tongue not understanded of the people.</p>
<h1>XXV.  Of the Sacraments.</h1>
<p>Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of Christian<br/>men's profession, but rather they be certain sure witnesses, and<br/>effectual signs of grace, and God's good will towards us, by the which<br/>he doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also<br/>strengthen and confirm our Faith in him.</p>
<p>There are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel, that<br/>is to say, Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord.</p>
<p>Those five commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation,<br/>Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and Extreme Unction, are not to be counted<br/>for Sacraments of the Gospel, being such as have grown partly of the<br/>corrupt following of the Apostles, partly are states of life allowed in<br/>the Scriptures; but yet have not like nature of Sacraments with Baptism,<br/>and the Lord's Supper, for that they have not any visible sign or<br/>ceremony ordained of God.</p>
<p>The Sacraments are not ordained of Christ to be gazed upon, or to be<br/>carried about, but that we should duly use them.  And in such only as<br/>worthily receive the same, they have a wholesome effect or operation:but<br/>they that receive them unworthily, purchase to themselves damnation, as<br/>Saint Paul saith.</p>
