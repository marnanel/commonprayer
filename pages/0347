<p><i>Ascension</i></p>
<p>Through thy dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ our Lord; who<br/>after his glorious resurrection manifestly appeared to his<br/>disciples; and in their sight ascended into heaven, to prepare<br/>a place for us; that where he is, there we might also be, and<br/>reign with him in glory.</p>
<p><i>Pentecost</i></p>
<p>Through Jesus Christ our Lord; according to whose true<br/>promise the Holy Ghost came down [on this day] from<br/>heaven, lighting upon the disciples, to teach them and to lead<br/>them into all truth; uniting peoples of many tongues in the<br/>confession of one faith, and giving to thy Church the power<br/>to serve thee as a royal priesthood, and to preach the Gospel<br/>to all nations.</p>

<p><i>Trinity Sunday</i></p>
<p>For with thy co-eternal Son and Holy Spirit, thou art one God,<br/>one Lord, in Trinity of Persons and in Unity of Substance;<br/>and we celebrate the one and equal glory of thee, O Father,<br/>and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><i>All Saints</i></p>
<p>Who, in the multitude of thy saints, hast compassed us about<br/>with so great a cloud of witnesses, that we, rejoicing in their<br/>fellowship, may run with patience the race that is set before<br/>us; and, together with them, may receive the crown of glory<br/>that fadeth not away.</p>
