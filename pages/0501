<h1>The Committal</h1>
<p><i>The following anthem or one of those on pages <a href="491.html">491</a>-<a href="492.html">492</a> is sung or said</i></p>
<p>Everyone the Father gives to me will come to me;<br/>I will never turn away anyone who believes in me.</p>
<p>He who raised Jesus Christ from the dead<br/>will also give new life to our mortal bodies<br/>through his indwelling Spirit.</p>
<p>My heart, therefore, is glad, and my spirit rejoices;<br/>my body also shall rest in hope.</p>
<p>You will show me the path of life;<br/>in your presence there is fullness of joy,<br/>and in your right hand are pleasures for evermore.</p>
<p><i>Then, while earth is cast on upon the coffin, the Celebrant says these<br/>words</i></p>
<p>In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life<br/>through our Lord Jesus Christ, we commend to Almighty<br/>God our <i>brother</i> <b><span class="person">N</span></b>, and we commit <i>his</i> body to the ground;**<br/>earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.  The Lord bless<br/><i>him</i> and keep <i>him</i>, the Lord make his face to shine upon <i>him</i><br/>and be gracious to <i>him</i>, the Lord lift up his countenance upon<br/><i>him</i> and give <i>him</i> peace.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>** <i>Or</i> the deep, <i>or</i> the elements, <i>or</i> its resting place.</p>
<p><i>The Celebrant says</i></p>
<p>The Lord be with you.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  And also with you.</p>
<p><i>Celebrant</i>  Let us pray.</p>
