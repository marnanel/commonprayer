<p>We give you thanks, O God, for the gifts of your people, and<br/>for the work of many hands, which have beautified this place<br/>and furnished it for the celebration of your holy mysteries.<br/>Accept and bless all we have done, and grant that in these<br/>earthly things we may behold the order and beauty of things<br/>heavenly; through Jesus christ our Lord. <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>The Bishop then says</i></p>
<p>Let us now pray for the setting apart of the Altar.</p>
<p><i>The Bishop goes to the Table and, with arms extended, says</i></p>
<p>We praise you, Almighty and eternal God, that for us and for<br/>our salvation, you sent your Son Jesus Christ to be born<br/>among us, that through him we might become your sons and<br/>daughters.<br/><i>Blessed be your Name, Lord God.</i></p>
<p>We praise you for his life on earth, and for his death upon the<br/>cross, through which he offered himself as a perfect sacrifice.<br/><i>Blessed be your Name, Lord God.</i></p>
<p>We praise you for raising him from the dead, and for exalting<br/>him to be our great High Priest.<br/><i>Blessed be your Name, Lord God.</i></p>
<p>We praise you for sending your Holy Spirit to make us holy,<br/>and to unite us in your holy Church.<br/><i>Blessed be your Name, Lord God.</i></p>
<p><i>The Bishop lays a hand upon the Table, and continues</i></p>
