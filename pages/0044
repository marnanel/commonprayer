<p>O come, let us sing unto the Lord; *<br/> let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our salvation.</p>
<p>Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving *<br/> and show ourselves glad in him with psalms.</p>
<p>For the Lord is a great God, *<br/> and a great King above all gods.</p>
<p>In his hand are the corners of the earth, *<br/> and the strength of the hills is his also.</p>
<p>The sea is his, and he made it, *<br/> and his hands prepared the dry land.</p>
