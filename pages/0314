<p>Heavenly Father, we thank you that by water and the Holy<br/>Spirit you have bestowed on upon this your servant the<br/>forgiveness of sin and have raised <i>him</i> to the new life of<br/>grace.  Strengthen <i>him,</i> O Lord, with your presence, enfold<br/><i>him</i> in the arms of your mercy, and keep <i>him</i> safe forever.</p>
<p><i>The person who administers emergency Baptism should inform the priest<br/>of the appropriate parish, so that the fact can be properly recorded.</i></p>
<p><i>If the baptized person recovers, the Baptism should be recognized<br/>at a public celebration of the Sacrament with a bishop or priest<br/>presiding, and the person baptized under emergency conditions,<br/>together with the sponsors or godparents, taking part in everything<br/>except the administration of the water.</i></p>
