<p>O God, you make us glad by the yearly festival of the birth<br/>of your only Son Jesus Christ:  Grant that we, who joyfully<br/>receive him as our Redeemer, may with sure confidence<br/>behold him when he comes to be our Judge; who lives and<br/>reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and<br/>for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
