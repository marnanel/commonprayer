<p>We praise you, we bless you,<br/>we give thanks to you,<br/>and we pray to you, Lord our God.</p>
<p><i>The Celebrant continues</i></p>
<p>Lord, we pray that in your goodness and mercy your Holy<br/>Spirit may descend upon us, and upon these gifts, sanctifying<br/>them and showing them to be holy gifts for your holy people,<br/>the bread of life and the cup of salvation, the Body and Blood<br/>of your Son Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Grant that all who share this bread and cup may become one<br/>body and one spirit, a living sacrifice in Christ, to the praise<br/>of your Name.</p>
<p>Remember, Lord, your one holy catholic and apostolic<br/>Church, redeemed by the blood of your Christ.  Reveal its<br/>unity, guard its faith, and preserve it in peace.</p>
<p>[Remember (NN. and) all who minister in your Church.]<br/>[Remember all your people, and those who seek your truth.]<br/>[Remember __________.]<br/>[Remember all who have died in the peace of Christ, and<br/>those whose faith is known to you alone; bring them into<br/>the place of eternal joy and light.]</p>
<p>And grant that we may find our inheritance with [the Blessed<br/>Virgin Mary, with patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs,<br/>(with __________) and] all the saints whe have found favor<br/>with you in ages past.  We praise you in union with them<br/>and give you glory through your Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p>Through Christ, and with Christ, and in Christ, all honor and<br/>glory are yours, Almighty God and Father, in the unity of the<br/>Holy Spirit, for ever and for ever.  <i>AMEN.</i></p>
