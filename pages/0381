<p>Because you are greatly glorified in the assembly of your<br/>saints.  All your creatures praise you, and your faithful<br/>servants bless you, confessing before the rulers of this world<br/>the great Name of your only Son.</p>
<h1>Apostles and Ordinations</h1>
<p>Through the great shepherd of your flock, Jesus Christ our<br/>Lord; who after his resurrection sent forth his apostles to<br/>preach the Gospel and to teach all nations; and promised to<br/>be with them always, even to the end of the ages.</p>
<h1>Dedication of a Church</h1>
<p>Through Jesus Christ our great High Priest; in whom we are<br/>built up as living stones of a holy temple, that we might offer<br/>before you a sacrifice of praise and prayer which is holy and<br/>pleasing in your sight.</p>
<h1>Baptism</h1>
<p>Because in Jesus Christ our Lord you have received us as your<br/>sons and daughters, made us citizens of your kingdom, and<br/>given us the Holy Spirit to guide us into all truth.</p>
<h1>Marriage</h1>
<p>Because in the love of wife and husband, you have given us<br/>an image of the heavenly Jerusalem, adorned as a bride for<br/>her bridegroom, your Son Jesus Christ our Lord; who loves<br/>her and gave himself for her, that he might make the whole<br/>creation new.</p>
