<p><i>7.  For the Church</i></p>
<p>Gracious Father, we pray for they holy Catholic Church.  Fill it<br/>with all truth, in all truth with all peace.  Where it is corrupt,<br/>purify it; where it is in error, direct it; where in any thing it is<br/>amiss, reform it.  Where it is right, strengthen it; where it is in<br/>want, provide for it; where it is divided, reunite it; for the sake<br/>of Jesus Christ thy Son our Savior.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
