<h1>At the Close of Day</h1>
<h1><a href="bible:Psalm+134">Psalm 134</a></h1>
<p>Behold now, bless the LORD, all you servants of the LORD, *<br/> you that stand by night in the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>Lift up your hands in the holy place and bless the LORD; *<br/> the LORD who made heaven and earth bless you out of Zion.</p>
<p><i>A Reading</i></p>
<p>Lord, you are in the midst of us and we are called by your<br/>Name:  Do not forsake us, O Lord our God.  <i><a href="bible:Jeremiah+14%3A9%2C22">Jeremiah 14:9,22</a></i></p>
<p><i>The following may be said</i></p>
<p>Lord, you now have set your servant free *<br/> to go in peace as you have promised;</p>
<p>For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *<br/> whom you have prepared for all the world to see;</p>
<p>A Light to enlighten the nations, *<br/> and the glory of your people Israel.</p>
<p><i>Prayers for ourselves and others may follow.  It is appropriate that<br/>prayers of thanksgiving for the blessings of the day, and penitence for<br/>our<br/>sins, be included.</i></p>
<p><i>The Lord's Prayer</i></p>
<p><i>The Collect</i></p>
<p>Visit this place, O Lord, and drive far from it all snares of the<br/>enemy; let your holy angles dwell with us to preserve us in<br/>peace; and let your blessing be upon us always; through Jesus<br/>Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>The almighty and merciful Lord, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,<br/>bless us and keep us.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
