<p>He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,<br/>  and his kingdom will have no end.</p>
<p>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,<br/> who proceeds from the Father and the Son.<br/> With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.<br/> He has spoken through the Prophets.<br/> We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.<br/> We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.<br/> We look for the resurrection of the dead,<br/>  and the life of the world to come.  Amen.</p>
