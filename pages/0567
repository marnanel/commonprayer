<h1>The Dedication and<br/>Consecration of a Church</h1>
<p><i>On the day appointed, the clergy and people gather with the bishop in a<br/>place apart from the church or chapel.</i></p>
<p><i>When all are ready, the Bishop says the following or similar words</i></p>
<p>Through the ages, Almighty God has moved his people to<br/>build houses of prayer and praise, and to set apart places for<br/>the ministry of his holy Word and Sacraments.  With gratitude<br/>for the building (rebuilding, <i>or</i> adornment) of (<i>name of<br/>church</i>), we are now gathered to dedicate and consecrate<br/>it in God's Name.</p>
<p>Let us pray.</p>
<p>Almighty God, we thank you for making us in your image, to<br/>share in the ordering of your world.  Receive the work of our<br/>hands in this place, now to be set apart for your worship, the<br/>building up of the living, and the remembrance of the dead,<br/>to the praise and glory of your Name; through Jesus Christ<br/>our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>Necessary announcements may now be made.</i></p>
<p><i>As the procession approaches the door of the church, singing and<br/>instrumental music are appropriate.</i></p>
