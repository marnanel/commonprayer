<p><i>Additional Directions</i></p>
<p><i>The complete form of the service for the Dedication and Consecration of<br/>a Church is to be used at the opening of a church or chapel.  This<br/>service does not require that the premises be debt-free or owned.</i></p>
<p><i>When the clergy and people assemble before the service, they may gather<br/>out of doors, in the parish house, in a former or neighboring place of<br/>worship, or in some other building.  When convenient, the procession may<br/>go around the building(s) to be dedicated and then go to the principal<br/>door.  Hymns or psalms may be used in procession. The use of portable<br/>musical instruments is suitable.  If there is an organ, it is<br/>appropriate that it remain silent until dedicated.  When the weather is<br/>inclement, or other circumstances make it necessary, the congregation<br/>may assemble inside the church; but the bishop, other clergy, and<br/>attendants will enter in procession through the principal door.</i></p>
<p><i>When a new church is being consecrated, it is desirable that sacred<br/>vessels, ornaments, and decorations be carried into the building in the<br/>procession.  Such things as the deed for the property and the blueprint<br/>of the building(s), the keys, and the tools used in its construction may<br/>also be carried by appropriate persons.</i></p>
<p><i>The cross signed on the threshold by the bishop may be marked in<br/>lasting from (incised, painted, inlaid).  In place of a pastoral staff,<br/>the foot of a processional cross may be used for the signing.</i></p>
<p><i>At the dedication of the font, children or other lay persons are to be<br/>assigned the task of pouring the water.  If Holy Baptism is not to be<br/>administered, in addition to saying the prayer over the font as given,<br/>the bishop may consecrate oil of Chrism, as in the service of Holy<br/>Baptism, for subsequent use in this church.</i></p>
<p><i>If Baptism is to be administered, the following order is used: The<br/>Gospel from "At Baptism," page <a href="928.html">928</a>; then the service of Holy Baptism,<br/>beginning with the Presentation of the Candidates, and concluding with<br/>the reception of the newly baptized.</i></p>
