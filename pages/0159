<h1>Collects:  Traditional</h1>
<h1>First Sunday of Advent</h1>
<p>Almighty God, give us grace that we may cast away the<br/>works of darkness, and put upon us the armor of light, now<br/>in the time of this mortal life in which thy Son Jesus Christ<br/>came to visit us in great humility; that in the last day, when<br/>he shall come again in his glorious majesty to judge both the<br/>quick and the dead, we may rise to the life immortal; through<br/>him who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost,<br/>one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<h1>Second Sunday of Advent</h1>
<p>Merciful God, who sent thy messengers the prophets to<br/>preach repentance and prepare the way for our salvation:<br/>Give us grace to heed their warnings and forsake our sins,<br/>that we may greet with joy the coming of Jesus Christ our<br/>Redeemer; who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy<br/>Spirit, one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
