<p>Grant that all married persons who have witnessed these vows<br/>may find their lives strengthened and their loyalties<br/>confirmed.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>Grant that the bonds of our common humanity, by which all<br/>your children are united one to another, and the living to the<br/>dead, may be so transformed by your grace, that your will may<br/>be done on earth as it is in heaven; where, O Father, with your<br/>Son, and the Holy Spirit, you live and reign in perfect unity,<br/>now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<h1>The Blessing of the Marriage</h1>
<p><i>The people remain standing.  The husband and wife kneel, and the Priest<br/>says one of the following prayers</i></p>
<p>Most gracious God, we give you thanks for your tender love<br/>in sending Jesus Christ to come among us, to be born of a<br/>human mother, and to make the way of the cross to be the<br/>way of life.  We thank you, also, for consecrating the union of<br/>man and woman in his Name.  By the power of your Holy<br/>Spirit, pour out the abundance of your blessing upon this<br/>man and this woman.  Defend them from every enemy.  Lead<br/>them into all peace.  Let their love for each other be a seal<br/>upon their hearts, a mantle about their shoulders, and a<br/>crown upon their foreheads.  Bless them in their work and in<br/>their companionship; in their sleeping and in their waking; in<br/>their joys and in their sorrows; in their life and in their death.<br/>Finally, in your mercy, bring them to that table where your<br/>saints feast for ever in your heavenly home; through Jesus<br/>Christ our Lord, who with you and the Holy Spirit lives and<br/>reigns, one God, for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
