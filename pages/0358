<p>We believe in one God,<br/> the Father, the Almighty,<br/> maker of heaven and earth,<br/> of all that is, seen and unseen.</p>
<p>We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,<br/> the only Son of God,<br/> eternally begotten of the Father,<br/> God from God, Light from Light,<br/> true God from true God,<br/> begotten, not made,<br/> of one Being with the Father.<br/> Through him all things were made.<br/> For us and for our salvation<br/>  he came down from heaven:<br/> by the power of the Holy Spirit<br/>  he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,<br/>  and was made man.<br/> For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br/>  he suffered death and was buried.<br/> On the third day he rose again<br/>  in accordance with the Scriptures;<br/> he ascended into heaven<br/>  and is seated at the right hand of the Father.</p>
