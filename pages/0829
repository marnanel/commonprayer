<p>every root of bitterness, the desire of vainglory, and the pride<br/>of life.  Fill them with faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance,<br/>patience, godliness.  Knit together in constant affection those<br/>who, in holy wedlock, have been made one flesh.  Turn the<br/>hearts of the parents to the children, and the hearts of the<br/>children to the parents; and so enkindle fervent charity among<br/>us all, that we may evermore be kindly affectioned one<br/>to another; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p><i>46.  For the Care of Children</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, heavenly Father, you have blessed us with the<br/>joy and care of children:  Give us calm strength and patient<br/>wisdom as we bring them up, that we may teach them to love<br/>whatever is just and true and good, following the example of<br/>our Savior Jesus Christ.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>47.  For Young Persons</i></p>
<p>God our Father, you see your children growing up in an<br/>unsteady and confusing world:  Show them that your ways<br/>give more life than the ways of the world, and that following<br/>you is better than chasing after selfish goals.  Help them to<br/>take failure, not as a measure of their worth, but as a chance<br/>for a new start.  Give them strength to hold their faith in you,<br/>and to keep alive their joy in your creation; through Jesus<br/>Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>48.  For Those Who Live Alone</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, whose Son had nowhere to lay his head:<br/>Grant that those who live alone may not be lonely in their<br/>solitude, but that, following in his steps, they may find<br/>fulfillment in loving you and their neighbors; through Jesus<br/>Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
