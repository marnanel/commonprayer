<p>4.  That this Church does not seek to absorb other Communions, but<br/>rather, co-operating with them on the basis of a common Faith and Order,<br/>to discountenance schism, to heal the wounds of the Body of Christ, and<br/>to promote the charity which is the chief of Christian graces and the<br/>visibile manifestation of Christ to the world.</p>
<p>But furthermore, we do hereby affirm that the Christian unity...can be<br/>restored only by the return of all Christian communions to the<br/>principles of unity exemplified by the undivided Catholic Church during<br/>the first ages of its existence; which principles we believe to be the<br/>substantial deposit of Christian Faith and Order committed by Christ and<br/>his Apostles to the Church unto the end of the world, and therefore<br/>incapable of compromise or surrender by those who have been ordained to<br/>be its stewards and trustees for the common and equal benefit of all<br/>men.</p>
<p>As inherent parts of this sacred deposit, and therefore as essential to<br/>the restoration of unity among the divided branches of Christendom, we<br/>account the following, to wit:</p>
<p>1.  The Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments as the revealed<br/>Word of God.</p>
<p>2.  The Nicene Creed as the sufficient statement of the Christian Faith.</p>
<p>3.  The two Sacraments,&mdash;Baptism and the Supper of the Lord,&mdash;ministered<br/>with unfailing use of Christ's words of institution and of the elements<br/>ordained by Him.</p>
<p>4.  The Historic Episcopate, locally adapted in the methods of its<br/>administration to the varying needs of the nations and peoples called of<br/>God into the unity of His Church.</p>
<p><i>Furthermore,</i> Deeply grieved by the sad divisions which affect the<br/>Christian Church in oun own land, we hereby declare our desire and<br/>readiness, so soon as there shall be any authorized response to this<br/>Declaration, to enter into brotherly conference with all or any<br/>Christian Bodies seeking the restoration of the organic unity of the<br/>Church, with a view to the earnest study of the conditions under which<br/>so priceless a blessing might happily be brought to pass.</p>
<p><i>Note:  While the above form of the Quadrilateral was adopted by the<br/>House of Bishops, it was not enacted by the House of Deputies, but<br/>rather incorporated in a general plan referred for study and action to a<br/>newly created Joint Commission on Christian Reunion.</i></p>
<p><i>Lambeth Conferent of 1888<br/>Resolution 11</i></p>
<p>That, in the opinion of this Conference, the following Articles supply a<br/>basis on which approach may be by God's blessing made towards Home<br/>Reunion:</p>
<p>(a) The Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, as "containing<br/>all things necessary to salvation," and as being the rule and ultimate<br/>standard of faith.</p>
<p>(b) The Apostles' Creed, as the Baptismal Symbol; and the Nicene Creed,<br/>as the sufficient statement of the Christian faith.</p>
