<p><i>Concerning the Lectionary</i></p>
<p><i>The Lectionary for Sundays is arranged in a three-year cycle, in which<br/>Year A always begins on the First Sunday of Advent in years evenly<br/>divisible by three.  (For example, 1977 divided by 3 is 659 with no<br/>remainder.  Year A, therefore, begins on Advent Sunday of that year.)</i></p>
<p><i>The Psalms and Lessons appointed for the Sundays and for other major<br/>Holy Days are intended for use at all public services on such days,<br/>except when the same congregation attends two or more services.  Thus,<br/>the same Lessons are to be read at the principal morning service,<br/>whether the Liturgy of the Word takes the form given in the Holy<br/>Eucharist, or that of the Daily Office.</i></p>
<p><i>When the same congregation is present for Morning or Evening Prayer, in<br/>addition to the Eucharist, the Lessons at the Office may be selected<br/>from one of the other years of the three-year Sunday cycle, or from the<br/>Lectionary for the Daily Office.  The Psalms at such Offices are<br/>normally those appointed in the Office Lectionary; but, when desired,<br/>the Psalm cited in the selected Sunday Proper may be used instead.</i></p>
<p><i>In this Lectionary, the selections from the Psalter are frequently<br/>cited in a longer and shorter version, usually from the same Psalm.  The<br/>longer version is particularly appropriate for use at the Office, the<br/>shorter version when the Psalm is sung between the Lessons at the<br/>Eucharist.  The selections may be further lengthened or shortened at<br/>discretion.</i></p>
<p><i>When an alternative Lesson is cited, it is sometimes identical with a<br/>Lesson appointed for the same day in the Daily Office Lectionary.</i></p>
<p><i>In the opening verses of Lessons, the Reader should omit initial<br/>conjunctions which refer only to what has preceded, substitute nouns for<br/>pronouns when the referent is not otherwise clear, or else prefix to the<br/>Reading some such introduction as, "<b><span class="person">N</span></b> said (to <b><span class="person">N</span></b>)."</i></p>
<p><i>Any Reading may be lengthened at discretion.  Suggested lengthenings<br/>are shown in parentheses.</i></p>
