<h1>Ascension Day</h1>
<p>Almighty God, whos blessed Son our Savior Jesus Christ<br/>ascended far above all heavens that he might fill all things:<br/>Mercifully give us faith to perceive that, according to his<br/>promise, he abides with his Church on earth, even to the end<br/>of the ages; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and<br/>reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, in glory<br/>everlasting.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>Grant, we pray, Almighty God, that as we believe your<br/>only-begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ to have ascended<br/>into heaven, so we may also in heart and mind there ascend,<br/>and with him continually dwell; who lives and reigns with<br/>you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<h1>Seventh Sunday of Easter:  The Sunday after Ascension Day</h1>
<p>O God, the King of glory, you have exalted your only Son<br/>Jesus Christ with great triumph to your kingdom in heaven:<br/>Do not leave us comfortless, but send us your Holy Spirit to<br/>strengthen us, and exalt us to that place where our Savior<br/>Christ has gone before; who lives and reigns with you and<br/>the Holy Spirit, one God, in glory everlasting.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
