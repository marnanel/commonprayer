<p>we have offended against thy holy laws,<br/>we have left undone those things which we ought to<br/>  have done,<br/>and we have done those things which we ought not to<br/>  have done.<br/>But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us,<br/>spare thou those who confess their faults,<br/>restore thou those who are penitent,<br/>according to thy promises declared unto mankind<br/>in Christ Jesus our Lord;<br/>and grand, O most merciful Father, for his sake,<br/>that we may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and sober life,<br/>to the glory of thy holy Name.  Amen.</p>
