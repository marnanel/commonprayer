<p>He has shown the strength of his arm,<br/> he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</p>
<p>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones,<br/> and has lifted up the lowly.</p>
<p>He has filled the hungry with good things,<br/> and the rich he has sent away empty.</p>
<p>He has come to the help of his servant Israel,<br/> for he has remembered his promise of mercy,</p>
<p>The promise he made to our fathers,<br/> to Abraham and his children for ever.</p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br/> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.</p>

<h1><a href="bible:Psalm+116">Psalm 116</a></h1>
<p>I love the LORD, because he has heard the voice of my<br/>  supplication, *<br/> because he has inclined his ear to me whenever I called<br/>  upon him.</p>
<p>Gracious is the LORD and righteous; *<br/> our God is full of compassion.</p>
<p>How shall I repay the LORD *<br/> for all the good things he has done for me?</p>
<p>I will lift up the cup of salvation *<br/> and call upon the Name of the LORD.</p>
<p>I will fulfill my vows to the LORD *<br/> in the presence of all his people.</p>
<p>In the courts of the LORD'S house, *<br/> in the midst of you, O Jerusalem.<br/> Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br/> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.</p>
