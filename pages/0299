<h1>Holy Baptism</h1>
<p><i>A hymn, psalm, or anthem may be sung.</i></p>
<p><i>The people standing, the Celebrant says</i></p>
<p>Blessed be God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><i>People</i>     And blessed be his kingdom, now and for ever.  Amen.</p>
<p><i>In place of the above, from Easter Day through the Day of Pentecost</i></p>
<p><i>Celebrant</i>     Alleluia.  Christ is risen.</p>
<p><i>People</i>     The Lord is risen indeed.  Alleluia.</p>
<p><i>In Lent and on other penitential occasions</i></p>
<p><i>Celebrant</i>  Bless the Lord who forgives all our sins.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  His mercy endures for ever.</p>
<p><i>The Celebrant then continues</i></p>
<p>There is one Body and one Spirit;</p>
<p><i>People</i>  There is one hope in God's call to us;</p>
<p><i>Celebrant</i>  One Lord, one Faith, one Baptism;</p>
<p><i>People</i>  One God and Father of all.</p>
<p><i>Celebrant</i>  The Lord be with you.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  And also with you.</p>
<p><i>Celebrant</i>  Let us pray.</p>
