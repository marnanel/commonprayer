<p><i>At the following words concerning the bread, the Celebrant is to hold<br/>it, or to lay a hand upon it; and at the words concerning the cup, to<br/>hold or place a hand upon the cup and any other vessel containing wine<br/>to be consecrated.</i></p>
<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our<br/>Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks<br/>to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said,<br/>"Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you.  Do this<br/>for the remembrance of me."</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given<br/>thanks, he gave it to them, and said, "Drink this, all of you:<br/>This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you<br/>and for many for the forgiveness of sins.  Whenever you drink<br/>it, do this for the remembrance of me."</p>
<p>Recalling now his suffering and death, and celebrating his<br/>resurrection and ascension, we await his coming in glory.</p>
<p>Accept, O Lord, our sacrifice of praise, this memorial of our<br/>redemption.</p>
<p>Send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts.  Let them be for us<br/>the Body and Blood of your Son.  And grant that we who eat<br/>this bread and drink this cup may be filled with your life and<br/>goodness.</p>
<p><i>The Celebrant then prays that all may receive the benefits of Christ's<br/>work, and the renewal of the Holy Spirit.</i></p>
<p><i>The Prayer concludes with these or similar words</i></p>
<p>All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ.  By him, and<br/>with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor<br/>and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.  AMEN.</p>
