<p>He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,<br/>    and his kingdom will have no end.</p>
<p>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,<br/>  who proceeds from the Father and the Son.<br/>  With the Father and the Son he is worshipped and glorified.<br/>  He has spoken through the Prophets.<br/>  We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.<br/>  We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.<br/>  We look for the resurrection of the dead,<br/>    and the life of the world to come.  Amen.</p>
<h1>The Consecration of the Bishop</h1>
<p><i>All continue to stand, except the bishop-elect, who kneels before the<br/>Presiding Bishop.  The other bishops stand to the right and left of the<br/>Presiding Bishop.</i></p>
<p><i>The hymn, Veni Creator Spiritus, or the hymn, Veni Sancte Spiritus, is<br/>sung.</i></p>
<p><i>A period of silent prayer follows, the people still standing.</i></p>
<p><i>The Presiding Bishop then begins this Prayer of Consecration</i></p>
<p>God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Father of mercies<br/>and God of all comfort, dwelling on high but having regard<br/>for the lowly, knowing all things before they come to pass:<br/>We give you thanks that from the beginning you have<br/>gathered and prepared a people to be heirs of the covenant of<br/>Abraham, and have raised up prophets, kings, and priests,<br/>never leaving your temple untended.  We praise you also that<br/>from the creation you have graciously accepted the ministry<br/>of those whom you have chosen.</p>
