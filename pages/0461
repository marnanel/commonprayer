<h1>Prayers for use by a Sick Person</h1>
<p><i>For Trust in God</i></p>
<p>O God, the source of all health: So fill my heart with faith in<br/>your love, that with calm expectancy I may make room for<br/>your power to possess me, and gracefully accept your<br/>healing; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>In Pain</i></p>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, by your patience in suffering you hallowed<br/>earthly pain and gave us the example of obedience to your<br/>Father's will: Be near me in my time of weakness and pain;<br/>sustain me by your grace, that my strength and courage may<br/>not fail; heal me according to your will; and help me always<br/>to believe that what happens to me here is of little account if<br/>you hold me in eternal life, my Lord and my God. <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>For Sleep</i></p>
<p>O heavenly Father, you give your children sleep for the<br/>refreshing of soul and body: Grant me this gift, I pray; keep<br/>me in that perfect peace which you have promised to those<br/>whose minds are fixed on you; and give me such a sense of<br/>your presence, that in the hours of silence I may enjoy the<br/>blessed assurance of your love; through Jesus Christ our<br/>Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>In the Morning</i></p>
<p>This is another day, O Lord.  I know not what it will bring<br/>forth, but make me ready, Lord, for whatever it may be.  If I<br/>am to stand up, help me to stand bravely.  If I am to sit still,<br/>help me to sit quietly.  If I am to lie low, help me to do it<br/>patiently.  And if I am to do nothing, let me do it gallantly.<br/>Make these words more than words, and give me the Spirit<br/>of Jesus.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
