<p><i>The Proper Liturgy for this day is on page <a href="270.html">270</a>.</i></p>
<p>Almighty and everliving God, who, of thy tender love<br/>towards mankind, hast sent thy Son our Savior Jesus Christ<br/>to take upon him our flesh, and to suffer death upon the<br/>cross, that all mankind should follow the example of his<br/>great humility:  Mercifully grant that we may both follow the<br/>example of his patience, and also be make partakers of his<br/>resurrection; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord, who<br/>liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, one God,<br/>for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<h1>Monday in Holy Week</h1>
<p>Almighty God, whose most dear Son went not up to joy but<br/>first he suffered pain, and entered not into glory before he<br/>was crucified:  Mercifully grant that we, walking in the way<br/>of the cross, may find it none other that the way of life and<br/>peace; through Jesus Christ thy Son our Lord, who<br/>liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, one God,<br/>for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<h1>Tuesday in Holy Week</h1>
<p>O God, by the passion of thy blessed Son didst make an<br/>instrument of shameful death to be unto us the means of life:<br/>Grant us so to glory in the cross of Christ, that we may gladly<br/>suffer shame and loss for the sake of thy Son our Savior Jesus<br/>Christ; who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit,<br/>one God, for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
