<h1>Canticle 9</h1> The First Song of Isaiah  <i>Ecce, Deus</i>
<p><i><a href="bible:Isaiah+12%3A2-6">Isaiah 12:2-6</a></i></p>
<p>Surely, it is God who saves me; *<br/> I will trust in him and not be afraid.</p>
<p>For the Lord is my stronghold and my sure defense, *<br/> and he will be my Savior.</p>
<p>Therefore you shall draw water with rejoicing *<br/> from the springs of salvation.</p>
<p>And on that day you shall say, *<br/> Give thanks to the Lord and call upon his Name;</p>
<p>Make his deeds known among the peoples; *<br/> see that they remember that his Name is exalted.</p>
<p>Sing praises of the Lord, for he has done great things, *<br/> and this is known in all the world.</p>
<p>Cry aloud, inhabitants of Zion, ring out your joy, *<br/> for the great one in the midst of you is the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br/> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.</p>
<h1>Canticle 10</h1>  The Second Song of Isaiah <i>Quaerite Dominum</i>
<p><i><a href="bible:Isaiah+55%3A6-11">Isaiah 55:6-11</a></i></p>
<p>Seek the Lord while he wills to be found; *<br/> call upon him when he draws near.</p>
<p>Let the wicked forsake their ways *<br/> and the evil ones their thoughts;</p>
<p>And let them turn to the Lord, and he will have compassion, *<br/> and to our God, for he will richly pardon.</p>
<p>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, *<br/> nor your ways my ways, says the Lord.</p>
<p>For as the heavens are higher than the earth, *<br/> so are my ways higher than your ways,<br/> and my thoughts than your thoughts.</p>
