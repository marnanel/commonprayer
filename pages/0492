<p>Happy from now on<br/>are those who die in the Lord!<br/>So it is, says the Spirit,<br/>for they rest from their labors.</p>
<p><i>Or else this anthem</i></p>
<p>In the midst of life we are in death;<br/>from whom can we seek help?<br/>From you alone, O Lord,<br/>who by our sins are justly angered.</p>
<p><i>Holy God, Holy and Mighty,<br/>Holy and merciful Savior,<br/>deliver us not into the bitterness of eternal death.</i></p>
<p>Lord, you know the secrets of our hearts;<br/>shut not your ears to our prayers,<br/>but spare us, O Lord.</p>
<p><i>Holy God, Holy and Mighty,<br/>Holy and merciful Savior,<br/>deliver us not into the bitterness of eternal death.</i></p>
<p>O worthy and eternal Judge,<br/>do not let the pains of death<br/>turn us away from you at our last hour.</p>
<p><i>Holy God, Holy and Mighty,<br/>Holy and merciful Savior,<br/>deliver us not into the bitterness of eternal death.</i></p>
<p><i>When all are in place, the Celebrant may address the congregation,<br/>acknowledging briefly the purpose of the gathering, and bidding their<br/>prayers for the deceased and the bereaved.</i></p>
