<p>You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High, *<br/> for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,</p>
<p>To give his people knowledge of salvation *<br/> by the forgiveness of their sins.</p>
<p>In the tender compassion of our God *<br/> the dawn from on high shall break upon us,</p>
<p>To shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death, *<br/>and to guide our feet into the way of peace.</p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br/> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.</p>

<p>A Light to enlighten the nations, *<br/> and the glory of your people Israel.</p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br/> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.</p>
