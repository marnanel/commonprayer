<p>O come, let us worship and fall down, *<br/> and kneel before the Lord our Maker.</p>
<p>For he is the Lord our God, *<br/> and we are the people of his pasture<br/> and the sheep of his hand.</p>
<p>O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness; *<br/> let the whole earth stand in awe of him.</p>
<p>For he cometh, for he cometh to judge the world<br/> and with righteousness to judge the world<br/> and the peoples with his truth.</p>

<h1>Jubilate</h1>  <i><a href="bible:Psalm+100">Psalm 100</a></i>
<p>Be joyful in the Lord, all ye lands; *<br/> serve the Lord with gladness<br/> and come before his presence with a song.</p>
<p>Be ye sure that the Lord he is God; *<br/> it is he that hath made us and we ourselves;<br/> we are his people and the sheep of his pasture.</p>
<p>O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving<br/>and into his courts with praise; *<br/> be thankful unto him and speak good of his Name.</p>
<p>For the Lord is gracious;<br/>his mercy is everlasting; *<br/> and his truth endureth from generation to generation.</p>
