<p>we go down to the dust; yet even at the grave we make<br/>our song:  Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.</p>
<p><i>Give rest, O Christ, to thy servant(s) with thy saints,<br/>where sorrow and pain are no more,<br/>neither sighing, but life everlasting.</i></p>
<p><i>The Celebrant, facing the body, says</i></p>
<p>Into thy hands, O merciful Savior, we commend thy servant<br/><b><span class="person">N</span></b>  Acknowledge, we humbly beseech thee, a sheep of thine<br/>own fold, a lamb of thine own flock, a sinner of thine own<br/>redeeming.  Receive <i>him</i> into the arms of thy mercy, into the<br/>blessed rest of everlasting peace, and into the glorious<br/>company of the saints in light.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>The Celebrant, or the Bishop if present, may then bless the people, and<br/>a Deacon or other Minister may dismiss them, saying</i></p>
<p>Let us go forth in the name of Christ.<br/><i>Thanks be to God.</i></p>
<p><i>As the body is borne from the church, a hymn, or one or more of these<br/>anthems may be sung or said</i></p>
<p>Christ is risen from the dead, trampling down death by death,<br/>and giving life to those in the tomb.</p>
<p>The Sun of Righteousness is gloriously risen, giving light to<br/>those who sat in darkness and in the shadow of death.</p>
<p>The Lord will guide our feet into the way of peace, having<br/>taken away the sin of the world.</p>
<p>Christ will open the kingdom of heaven to all who believe in<br/>his Name, saying, Come, O blessed of my Father; inherit the<br/>kingdom prepared for you.</p>
