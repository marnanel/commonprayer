<p>14  I shall teach your ways to the wicked, *<br/>and sinners shall return to you.</p>
<p>15  Deliver me from death, O God, *<br/> and my tongue shall sing of your righteousness,<br/> O God of my salvation.</p>
<p>16  Open my lips, O Lord, *<br/>and my mouth shall proclaim your praise.</p>
<p>17  Had you desired it, I would have offered sacrifice; *<br/>but you take no delight in burnt-offerings.</p>
<p>18  The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit; *<br/> a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.</p>
<h1>Litany of Penitence</h1>
<p><i>The Celebrant and People together, all kneeling</i></p>
<p>Most holy and merciful Father:<br/>We confess to you and to one another,<br/>and to the whole communion of saints<br/>in heaven and on earth,<br/>that we have sinned by our own fault<br/>in thought, word, and deed;<br/>by what we have done, and by what we have left undone.</p>
<p><i>The Celebrant continues</i></p>
<p>We have not loved you with our whole heart, and mind, and<br/>strength. We have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.  We<br/>have not forgiven others, as we have been forgiven.<br/><i>Have mercy on us, Lord.</i></p>
<p>We have been deaf to your call to serve, as Christ served us.<br/>We have not been true to the mind of Christ.  We have grieved<br/>your Holy Spirit.<br/><i>Have mercy on us, Lord.</i></p>
