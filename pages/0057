<p><i>A Collect for Peace</i></p>
<p>O God, who art the author of peace and lover of concord,<br/>in knowledge of whom standeth our eternal life, whose service<br/>is perfect freedom:  Defend us, thy humble servants, in all<br/>assaults of our enemies; that we, surely trusting in thy<br/>defense, may not fear the power of any adversaries; through<br/>the might of Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>A Collect for Grace</i></p>
<p>O Lord, our heavenly Father, almighty and everlasting God,<br/>who hast safely brought us to the beginning of this day:<br/>Defend us in the same with thy mighty power; and grant that<br/>this day we fall into no sin, neither run into any kind of<br/>danger; but that we, being ordered by thy governance, may<br/>do always what is righteous in thy sight; through Jesus Christ<br/>our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>A Collect for Guidance</i></p>
<p>O heavenly Father, in whom we live and move and have our<br/>being:  We humbly pray thee so to guide and govern us by thy<br/>Holy Spirit, that in all the cares and occupations of our life<br/>we may not forget thee, but may remember that we are ever<br/>walking in thy sight; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>Then, unless the Eucharist or a form of general intercession is to<br/>follow, one of these prayers for mission is added</i></p>
<p>Almighty and everlasting God, by whose Spirit the whole<br/>body of thy faithful people is governed and sanctified:<br/>Receive our supplications and prayers which we offer before<br/>thee for all members of thy holy Church, that in their<br/>vocation and ministry they may truly and godly serve thee;<br/>through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
