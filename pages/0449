<p><i>The Priest and Penitent begin as follows</i></p>
<p>Have mercy on me, O God, according to your loving-kindness;<br/> in your great compassion blot out my offenses.</p>
<p>Wash me through and through from my wickedness,<br/> and cleanse me from my sin.</p>
<p>For I know my transgressions only too well,<br/> and my sin is ever before me.</p>
<p>Holy God, Holy and Mighty, Holy Immortal One,<br/> have mercy upon us.</p>
<p><i>Penitent</i>  Pray for me, a sinner.</p>
<p><i>Priest</i></p>
<p>May God in his love enlighten your heart, that you may<br/>remember in truth all your sins and his unfailing mercy.<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>The Priest may then say one or more of these or other appropriate<br/>verses of Scripture, first saying</i></p>
<p>Hear the Word of God to all who truly turn to him.</p>
<p>Come to me, all ye that travail and are heavy laden, and I<br/>will refresh you.    <i><a href="bible:Matthew+11%3A28">Matthew 11:28</a></i></p>
<p>God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son,<br/>to the end that all that believe in him should not perish, but<br/>have everlasting life.    <i><a href="bible:John+3%3A16">John 3:16</a></i></p>
