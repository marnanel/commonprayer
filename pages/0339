<p><i>After Communion, the Celebrant says</i></p>
<p>Let us pray.</p>
<p><i>The People may join in saying this prayer</i></p>
<p>Almighty and everliving God, we most heartily thank thee<br/>for that thou dost feed us, in these holy mysteries, with the<br/>spiritual food of the most precious Body and Blood of thy<br/>Son our Savior Jesus Christ; and dost assure us thereby of<br/>thy favor and goodness towards us; and that we are very<br/>members incorporate in the mystical body of thy Son, the<br/>blessed company of all faithful people; and are also heirs,<br/>through hope, of thy everlasting kingdom.  And we humbly<br/>beseech thee, O heavenly Father, so to assist us with thy<br/>grace, that we may continue in that holy fellowship, and do<br/>all such good works as thou hast prepared for us to walk in;<br/>through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom with thee and the<br/>Holy Ghost, be all honor and glory, world without end.<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>The Bishop when present, or the Priest, gives the blessing</i></p>
<p>The peace of God, which passeth all understanding, keep<br/>your hearts and minds in the knowledge and love of God,<br/>and of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord; and the blessing of<br/>God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, be<br/>amongst you, and remain with you always.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>The blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the<br/>Holy Spirit, be upon you and remain with you for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>The Deacon, or the Celebrant, may dismiss the people with these words</i></p>
<p>Let us go forth in the name of Christ.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  Thanks be to God.</p>
