<h1>The Ordination of a Deacon</h1>
<p><i>A hymn, psalm, or anthem may be sung.</i></p>
<p><i>The people standing, the Bishop says</i></p>
<p>Blessed be God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  And blessed be his kingdom, now and for ever.  Amen.</p>
<p><i>In place of the above, from Easter Day through the Day of Pentecost</i></p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>  Alleluia.  Christ is risen.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  The Lord is risen indeed.  Alleluia.</p>
<p><i>In Lent and on other penitential occasions</i></p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>  Bless the Lord who forgives all our sins.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  His mercy endures for ever.</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, to you all hearts are open, all desires known,<br/>and from you no secrets are hid: Cleanse the thoughts of our<br/>hearts by the inspiration of your Holy Spirit, that we may<br/>perfectly love you, and worthily magnify your holy Name;<br/>through Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
