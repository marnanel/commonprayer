<h1>At the Great Thanksgiving</h1>
<p><i>In making Eucharist, the Celebrant uses one of the Eucharistic Prayers<br/>from Rite One or Rite Two, or one of the following forms</i></p>
<h1>Form 1</h1>
<p><i>Celebrant</i>  The Lord be with you.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  And also with you.</p>
<p><i>Celebrant</i>  Lift up your hearts.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  We lift them to the Lord.</p>
<p><i>Celebrant</i>  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  It is right to give him thanks and praise.</p>
<p><i>The Celebrant gives thanks to God the Father for his work in creation<br/>and his revelation of himself to his people;</i></p>
<p><i>Recalls before God, when appropriate, the particular occasion being<br/>celebrated;</i></p>
<p><i>Incorporates or adapts the Proper Preface of the Day, if desired.</i></p>
<p>[[<i>If the Sanctus is to be included, it is introduced with these or<br/>similar words</i></p>
<p>And so we join the saints and angels in proclaiming your glory, as  we<br/>sing (say),</p>
<p><i>Celebrant and People</i></p>
<p>Holy, Holy, Holy Lord, God of power and might,<br/> heaven and earth are full of your glory.<br/>    Hosanna in the highest.<br/>Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.<br/>    Hosanna in the highest.</p>
