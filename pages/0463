<p>Holy Trinity, one God,<br/><i>Have mercy on your servant.</i></p>
<p>From all evil, from all sin, from all tribulation,<br/><i>Good Lord, deliver him.</i></p>
<p>By your holy Incarnation, by your Cross and Passion, by<br/>your precious Death and Burial,<br/><i>Good Lord, deliver him.</i></p>
<p>By your glorious Resurrection and Ascension, and by the<br/>Coming of the Holy Spirit,<br/><i>Good Lord, deliver him.</i></p>
<p>We sinners beseech you to hear us, Lord Christ: That it may<br/>please you to deliver the soul of your servant from the power<br/>of evil, and from eternal death,<br/><i>We beseech you to hear us, good Lord.</i></p>
<p>That it may please you mercifully to pardon all <i>his</i> sins,<br/><i>We beseech you to hear us, good Lord.</i></p>
<p>That it may please you to grant <i>him</i> a place of refreshment<br/>and everlasting blessedness,<br/><i>We beseech you to hear us, good Lord.</i></p>
<p>That it may please you to give <i>him</i> joy and gladness in your<br/>kingdom, with your saints in light,<br/><i>We beseech you to hear us, good Lord.</i></p>
<p>Jesus, Lamb of God:<br/><i>Have mercy on <i>him</i>.</i></p>
<p>Jesus, bearer of our sins:<br/><i>Have mercy on <i>him</i>.</i></p>
<p>Jesus, redeemer of the world:<br/><i>Give <i>him</i> your peace.</i></p>
