<p><i>All now sit, except the bishop-elect, who stands facing the bishops.<br/>The Presiding Bishop addresses the bishop-elect</i></p>
<p>My <i>brother</i>, the people have chosen you and have affirmed<br/>their trust in you by acclaiming your election.  A bishop in<br/>God's holy Church is called to be one with the apostles in<br/>proclaiming Christ's resurrection and interpreting the Gospel,<br/>and to testify to Christ's sovereignty as Lord of lords and<br/>King of kings.</p>
<p>You are called to guard the faith, unity, and discipline of the<br/>Church; to celebrate and to provide for the administration of<br/>the sacraments of the New Covenant; to ordain priests and<br/>deacons and to join in ordaining bishops; and to be in all<br/>things a faithful pastor and wholesome example for the<br/>entire flock of Christ.</p>
<p>With your fellow bishops you will share in the leadership of<br/>the Church throughout the world.  Your heritage is the faith<br/>of patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs, and those of<br/>every generation who have looked to God in hope.  Your joy<br/>will be to follow him who came, not to be served, but to<br/>serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.</p>
<p>Are you persuaded that God has called you to the office of<br/>bishop?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>  I am so persuaded.</p>
<p><i>The following questions are then addressed to the bishop-elect by one<br/>or more of the other bishops</i></p>
