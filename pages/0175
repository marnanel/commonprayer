<h1>Seventh Sunday of Easter:  The Sunday after Ascension Day</h1>
<p>O God, the King of glory, you have exalted thine only Son<br/>Jesus Christ with great triumph to thy kingdom in heaven:<br/>We beseech thee, leave us not comfortless, but send us<br/>thine Holy Ghost to comfort us, and exalt us to the same<br/>place where our Savior Christ is gone before; who liveth<br/>and reigneth with thee and the same Holy Ghost, one God,<br/>world without end.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>Preface of the Ascension</i></p>
<h1>The Day of Pentecost:  Whitsunday</h1>
<p><i>When a Vigil of Pentecost is observed, it begins with the Service of<br/>Light, page <a href="109.html">109</a> (substituting, if desired, the Gloria in Excelsis for<br/>the Phos hilaron), and continues with the Salutation and Collect of the<br/>Day.  Three or more of the appointed Lessons are read before the Gospel,<br/>each followed by a Psalm, Canticle, or hymn.  Holy Baptism or<br/>Confirmation (beginning with the Presentation of the Candidates), or the<br/>Renewal of Baptismal Vows, page <a href="292.html">292</a>, follows the Sermon.</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, who on this day didst open the way of eternal<br/>life to every race and nation by the promised gift of thy Holy<br/>Spirit:  Shed abroad this gift throughout the world by the<br/>preaching of the Gospel, that it may reach to the ends of the<br/>earth; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth<br/>with thee, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever<br/>and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>O God, who on this day didst teach the hearts of thy faithful<br/>people by sending to them the light of thy Holy Spirit: Grant<br/>us by the same Spirit to have a right judgment in all things, and<br/>evermore to rejoice in his holy comfort; through the merits of<br/>Christ Jesus our Savior, who liveth and reigneth with thee, in<br/>the unity of the same Spirit, one God, world without end.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
