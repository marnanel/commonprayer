<p>O God, who hast made of one blood all the peoples of the<br/>earth, and didst send thy blessed Son to preach peace to those<br/>who are far off and to those who are near:  Grant that people<br/>everywhere may seek after thee and find thee; bring the<br/>nations into thy fold; pour out thy Spirit upon all flesh; and<br/>hasten the coming of thy kingdom; through the same thy<br/>Son Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, who didst stretch out thine arms of love<br/>on the hard wood of the cross that everyone might come<br/>within the reach of thy saving embrace:  So clothe us in thy<br/>Spirit that we, reaching forth our hands in love, may bring<br/>those who do not know thee to the knowledge and love of<br/>you; for the honor of thy Name.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
