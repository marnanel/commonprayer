<p>For when thou are angry all our days are gone; *<br/> we bring our years to an end, as it were a tale that is told.</p>
<p>The days of our age are threescore years and ten;<br/>and though men be so strong that thy come to fourscore years, *<br/> yet is their strength then but labor and sorrow,<br/> so soon passeth it away, and we are gone.</p>
<p>So teach us to number our days, *<br/> that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.</p>
<h1><a href="bible:Psalm+121">Psalm 121</a></h1>  <i>Levavi oculos</i>
<p>I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills; *<br/> from whence cometh my help?</p>
<p>My help cometh even from the LORD, *<br/> who hath made heaven and earth.</p>
<p>He will not suffer thy foot to be moved, *<br/> and he that keepeth thee will not sleep.</p>
<p>Behold, he that keepeth Israel *<br/> shall neither slumber nor sleep.</p>
<p>The LORD himself is thy keeper; *<br/> the LORD is thy defence upon thy right hand;</p>
<p>So that the sun shall not burn by day, *<br/> neither the moon by night.</p>
<p>The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil; *<br/> yea, it is even he that shall keep thy soul.</p>
<p>The LORD shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in, *<br/> from this time forth for evermore.</p>
