<h1>The First Book of Common Prayer (1549)</h1>
<p>There was never any thing by the wit of man so well devised, or so sure<br/>established, which in continuance of time hath not been corrupted: as,<br/>among other things, it may plainly appear by the common prayers in the<br/>Church, commonly called Divine Service: the first original and ground<br/>whereof, if a man would search out by the ancient fathers, he shall<br/>find, that the same was not ordained, but of a good purpose, and for a<br/>great advancement of godliness: For they so ordered the matter, that all<br/>the whole Bible (or the greatest part thereof) should be read over once<br/>in the year, intending thereby, that the Clergy, and especially such as<br/>were Ministers of the congregation, should (by often reading, and<br/>meditation of God's word) be stirred up to godliness themselves, and be<br/>more able to exhort others by wholesome doctrine, and to confute them<br/>that were adversaries to the truth.  And further, that the people (by<br/>daily hearing of holy Scripture read in the Church) should continually<br/>profit more and more in the knowledge of God, and be the more inflamed<br/>with the love of his true religion.</p>
<p>But these many years passed, this godly and decent order of the ancient<br/>fathers hath been so altered, broken, and neglected, by planting in<br/>uncertain stories, Legends, Responds, Verses, vain repetitions,<br/>Commemorations, and Synodals, that commonly when any book of the Bible<br/>was begun, before three or four Chapters were read out, all the rest<br/>were unread.  And in this sort the book of Isaiah was begun in Advent,<br/>and the book of Genesis in Septuagesima; but they were only begun, and<br/>never read through.  After a like sort were other books of holy<br/>Scripture used.  And moreover, whereas St. Paul would have such language<br/>spoken to the people in the Church, as they might understand, and have<br/>profit by hearing the same, the Service in the Church of England (these<br/>many years) hath been read in Latin to the people, which they understood<br/>not; so that they have heard with their ears only; and their hearts,<br/>spirit, and mind, have not been edified thereby.  And furthermore,<br/>notwithstanding that the ancient fathers had divided the Psalms into<br/>seven portions, whereof every one was called a nocturn, now of late time<br/>a few of them have been daily said (and oft repeated), and the rest<br/>utterly omitted.  Moreover, the number and hardness of the Rules called<br/>the Pie, and the manifold changings of the service, was the cause, that<br/>to turn the Book only, was so hard and intricate a matter, that many<br/>times, there was more business to find out what should be read, than to<br/>read it when it was found out.</p>
<p>These inconveniences therefore considered, here is set forth such an<br/>order, whereby the same shall be redressed.  And for a readiness in this<br/>matter, here is drawn out a Kalendar for that purpose, which is plain<br/>and easy to be understood, wherein (so much as may be) the reading of<br/>holy Scripture is so set forth, that all things shall be done in order,<br/>without breaking one piece thereof from another.  For this cause be cut<br/>off Anthems, Responds, Invitatories, and such like things, as did break<br/>the continual course of the reading of the Scripture.</p>
<p>Yet because there is no remedy, but that of necessity there must be some<br/>rules: therefore certain rules are here set forth, which, as they be few<br/>in number; so they be plain and easy to be understood.  So that here you<br/>have an order for prayer (as touching the reading of the holy<br/>Scripture), much agreeable to the mind and purpose of the old fathers,<br/>and a great deal more profitable and commodious, than that which of late<br/>was used.  It is more profitable, because here are left out many things,<br/>whereof some be untrue, some uncertain, same vain</p>
