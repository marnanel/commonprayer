<h1><a href="bible:Psalm+23">Psalm 23</a></h1>  <i>Dominus regit me</i>
<p>The LORD is my shepherd; *<br/> therefore can I lack nothing.</p>
<p>He shall feed me in a green pasture, *<br/> and lead me forth in the paths of righteousness for his<br/>  Name's sake.</p>
<p>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,<br/>I will fear no evil; *<br/> for thou art with me;<br/> thy rod and thy staff comfort me.</p>
<p>Thou shalt prepare a table before me in the presence of them<br/>  that trouble me; *<br/> thou hast anointed my head with oil,<br/> and my cup shall be full.</p>
<p>Surely thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the<br/>  days of my life; *<br/> and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.</p>
<h1><a href="bible:Psalm+23">Psalm 23</a></h1>  <i>King James Version</i>
<p>The LORD is my shepherd; *<br/> I shall not want.</p>
<p>He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; *<br/> he leadeth me beside the still waters.</p>
<p>He restoreth my soul; *<br/> he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his<br/>  Name's sake.</p>
