<p><i>Concerning the Service</i></p>
<p>Christian marriage is a solemn and public covenant between a man and a<br/>woman in the presence of God.  In the Episcopal Church it is required<br/>that one, at least, of the parties must be a baptized Christian; that<br/>the ceremony be attested by at least two witnesses; and that the<br/>marriage conform to the laws of the State and the canons of this<br/>Church.*</p>
<p><i>A priest or a bishop normally presides at the Celebration and Blessing<br/>of a Marriage, because such ministers alone have the function of<br/>pronouncing the nuptial blessing, and of celebrating the Holy<br/>Eucharist.</i></p>
<p><i>When both a bishop and a priest are present and officiating, the bishop<br/>should pronounce the blessing and preside at the Eucharist.</i></p>
<p><i>A deacon, or an assisting priest, may deliver the charge, ask for the<br/>Declaration of Consent, read the Gospel, and perform other assisting<br/>functions at the Eucharist.</i></p>
<p><i>Where it is permitted by civil law that deacons may perform marriages,<br/>and no priest or bishop is available, a deacon may use the service which<br/>follows, omitting the nuptial blessing which follows The Prayers.</i></p>
<p><i>It is desirable that the Lessons from the Old Testament and the<br/>Epistles be read by lay persons.</i></p>
<p><i>In the opening exhortation (at the symbol of <b><span class="person">N</span></b> <b><span class="person">N</span></b>), the full names<br/>of the persons to be married are declared.  Subsequently, only their<br/>Christian names are used.</i></p>
