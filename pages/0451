<p>Do you, then, forgive those who have sinned against you?</p>
<p><i>Penitent</i>  I forgive them.</p>
<p><i>Priest</i></p>
<p>May Almighty God in mercy receive your confession of<br/>sorrow and of faith, strengthen you in all goodness, and by<br/>the power of the Holy Spirit keep you in eternal life.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>The Priest then lays a hand upon the penitent's head (or extends a hand<br/>over the penitent), saying one of the following</i></p>
<p>Our Lord Jesus Christ, who offered himself to be sacrificed<br/>for us to the Father, and who conferred power on his Church<br/>to forgive sins, absolve you through my ministry by the grace<br/>of the Holy Spirit, and restore you in the perfect peace of the<br/>Church.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>Our Lord Jesus Christ, who has left power to his Church to<br/>absolve all sinners who truly repent and believe in him, of<br/>his great mercy forgive you all your offenses; and by his<br/>authority committed to me, I absolve you from all your sins:<br/>In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy<br/>Spirit.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>The Priest concludes</i></p>
<p>Now there is rejoicing in heaven; for you were lost, and<br/>are found; you were dead, and are now alive in Christ Jesus<br/>our Lord.  Go (or abide) in peace.  The Lord has put away all<br/>your sins.</p>
<p><i>Penitent</i>  Thanks be to God.</p>
