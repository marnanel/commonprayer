<p>For as rain and snow fall from the heavens *<br/> and return not again, but water the earth,</p>
<p>Bringing forth life and giving growth, *<br/> seed for sowing and bread for eating,</p>
<p>So is my word that goes forth from my mouth; *<br/> it will not return to me empty;</p>
<p>But it will accomplish that which I have purposed, *<br/> and prosper in that for which I sent it.</p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br/> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.</p>
<h1>Canticle 11</h1>  The Third Song of Isaiah  <i>Surge, illuminare</i>
<p><i><a href="bible:Isaiah+60%3A1-3%2C11">Isaiah 60:1-3, 11</a>a, 14c, 18-19</i></p>
<p>Arise, shine, for your light has come, *<br/> and the glory of the Lord has dawned upon you.</p>
<p>For behold, darkness covers the land; *<br/> deep gloom enshrouds the peoples.</p>
<p>But over you the Lord will rise, *<br/> and his glory will appear upon you.</p>
<p>Nations will stream to your light, *<br/> and kings to the brightness of your dawning.</p>
<p>Your gates will always be open; *<br/> by day or night they will never be shut.</p>
<p>They will call you, The City of the Lord, *<br/> The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p>Violence will no more be heard in your land, *<br/> ruin or destruction within your borders.</p>
<p>You will call your walls, Salvation, *<br/> and all your portals, Praise.</p>
<p>The sun will no more be your light by day; *<br/> by night you will not need the brightness of the moon.</p>
