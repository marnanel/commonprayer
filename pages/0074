<p><i>Concerning the Service</i></p>
<p><i>In the Daily Office, the term "Officiant" is used to denote the person,<br/>clerical or lay, who leads the Office.</i></p>
<p><i>It is appropriate that other persons be assigned to read the Lessons,<br/>and to lead other parts of the service not assigned to the officiant.<br/>The bishop, when present, appropriately concludes the Office with a<br/>blessing.</i></p>
<p><i>At celebrations of the Holy Eucharist, the Order for Morning or Evening<br/>Prayer may be used in place of all that precedes the Offeratory.</i></p>
<p><i>Additional Directions are on page <a href="141.html">141</a>.</i></p>
