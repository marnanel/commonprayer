<p><b><span class="person">N</span></b>, may the Holy Spirit, who has begun a good work in you,<br/>direct and uphold you in the service of Christ and his<br/>kingdom.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>The Bishop concludes with this prayer</i></p>
<p>Almighty and everlasting God, let your fatherly hand ever be over<br/><i>these</i> your <i>servants</i>; let your Holy Spirit ever be<br/>with <i>them</i>; and so lead <i>them</i> in the knowledge and obedience of<br/>your Word, that <i>they</i> may serve you in this life, and dwell<br/>with you in the life to come; through Jesus Christ our Lord.<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>The Peace is then exchanged</i></p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>  The peace of the Lord be always with you.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  And also with you.</p>
<p><i>The service then continues with the Prayers of the People or the<br/>Offertory of the Eucharist, at which the Bishop should be the principal<br/>celebrant.</i></p>
<p><i>If there is no celebration of the Eucharist, the service continues with<br/>the Lord's Prayer and such other devotions as the Bishop may direct.</i></p>
<p><i>The Bishop may consecrate oil of Chrism for use at Baptism, using the<br/>prayer on page <a href="307.html">307</a>.</i></p>
