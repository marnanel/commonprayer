<p><i>Marriage</i></p>
<p>Because in the love of wife and husband, thou hast given us<br/>an image of the heavenly Jerusalem, adorned as a bride for<br/>her bridegroom, thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord; who loveth<br/>her and gave himself for her, that he might make the whole<br/>creation new.</p>
<p><i>Commemoration of the Dead</i></p>
<p>Through Jesus Christ our Lord; who rose victorious from the<br/>dead, and doth comfort us with the blessed hope of<br/>everlasting life; for to thy faithful people, O Lord, life is<br/>changed, not ended; and when our mortal body doth lie in<br/>death, there is prepared for us a dwelling place eternal in the<br/>heavens.</p>
