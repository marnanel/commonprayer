<p>Thou hast beset me behind and before, *<br/> and laid thine hand upon me.</p>
<p>Such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me; *<br/> I cannot attain unto it.</p>
<p>Whither shall I go then from thy Spirit? *<br/> or whither shall I go then from thy presence?</p>
<p>If I climb up into heaven, thou art there; *<br/> if I go down to hell, thou art there also.</p>
<p>If I take the wings of the morning, *<br/> and remain in the uttermost parts of the sea;</p>
<p>Even there also shall thy hand lead me, *<br/> and thy right hand shall hold me.</p>
<p>If I say, Peradventure the darkness shall cover me, *<br/> then shall my night be turned to day.</p>
<p>Yea, the darkness is no darkness with thee,<br/>but the night is as clear as day; *<br/> the darkness and light to thee are both alike.</p>
