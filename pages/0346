<p><i>Epiphany</i></p>
<p>Because in the mystery of the Word made flesh, thou hast<br/>caused a new light to shine in our hearts, to give the knowledge<br/>of thy glory in the face of thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p><i>Lent</i></p>
<p>Through Jesus Christ our Lord; who was in every way<br/>tempted as we are, yet did not sin; by whose grace we are<br/>able to triumph over every evil, and to live no longer unto<br/>outselves, but unto him who died for us and rose again.</p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>Who dost bid thy faithful people cleanse their hearts, and<br/>prepare with joy for the Paschal feast; that, fervent in prayer<br/>and in works of mercy, and renewed by thy Word and<br/>Sacraments, they may come to the fulness of grace which<br/>thou hast prepared for those who love thee.</p>
<p><i>Holy Week</i></p>
<p>Through Jesus Christ our Lord; who for our sins was lifted<br/>high upon the cross, that he might draw the whole world to<br/>himself; who by his suffering and death became the author of<br/>eternal salvation for all who put their trust in him.</p>
<p><i>Easter</i></p>
<p>But chiefly are we bound to praise thee for the glorious<br/>resurrection of thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord; for he is the<br/>very Paschal Lamb, who was sacrificed for us, and hath<br/>taken away the sin of the world; who by his death hath<br/>destroyed death, and by his rising to life again hath won for<br/>us everlasting life.</p>
