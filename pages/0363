<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given<br/>thanks, he gave it to them, and said, "Drink this, all of you:<br/>This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you<br/>and for many for the forgiveness of sins.  Whenever you drink<br/>it, do this for the remembrance of me."</p>
<p>Therefore we proclaim the mystery of faith:</p>
<p><i>Celebrant and People</i></p>
<p>Christ has died.</p>
<p>Christ is risen.</p>
<p>Christ will come again.</p>
<p><i>The Celebrant continues</i></p>
<p>We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in<br/>this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving.  Recalling his death,<br/>resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.</p>
<p>Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the<br/>Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new<br/>and unending life in him.  Sanctify us also that we may faithfully<br/>receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy,<br/>and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints<br/>into the joy of your eternal kingdom.</p>
<p>All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ: By him, and<br/>with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor<br/>and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.  <i>AMEN.</i></p>
