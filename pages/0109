<p>Jesus said, "You are the light of the world.  A city built on a<br/>hill cannot be hid.  No one lights a lamp to put it under a<br/>bucket, but on a lamp-stand where it gives light for everyone<br/>in the house.  And you, like the lamp, must shed light among<br/>your fellow men, so that they may see the deed you do, and<br/>give glory to your Father in heaven."  <i><a href="bible:Matthew+5%3A14-16">Matthew 5:14-16</a></i></p>
