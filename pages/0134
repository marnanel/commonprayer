<p><i>A Collect for Saturdays</i></p>
<p>We give thanks, O God, for revealing your Son Jesus<br/>Christ to us by the light of his resurrection:  Grant that as we<br/>sing your glory at the close of this day, our joy may abound<br/>in the morning as we celebrate the Paschal mystery; through<br/>Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>One of the following prayers may be added</i></p>
<p>Keep watch, dear Lord, with those who work, or watch, or<br/>weep this night, and give your angels charge over those who<br/>sleep.  Tend the sick, Lord Christ; give rest to the weary, bless<br/>the dying, soothe the suffering, pity the afflicted, shield the<br/>joyous; and all for your love's sake.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>O God, your unfailing providence sustains the world we live<br/>in and the life we live:  Watch over those, both night and day,<br/>who work while others sleep, and grant that we may never<br/>forget that our common life depends upon each other's toil;<br/>through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>Silence may be kept, and free intercessions and thanksgivings may be<br/>offered.</i></p>
<p><i>The service concludes with the Song of Simeon with this Antiphon, which<br/>is sung or said by all</i></p>
<p>Guide us waking, O Lord, and guard us sleeping; that awake<br/>we may watch with Christ, and asleep we may rest in peace.</p>
<p><i>In Easter Season, add</i>  Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.</p>
