<h1>The Examination</h1>
<p><i>All are seated except the ordinand, who stands before the Bishop.</i></p>
<p><i>The Bishop addresses the ordinand as follows</i></p>
<p>My <i>brother</i>, the Church is the family of God, the body of<br/>Christ, and the temple of the Holy Spirit.  All baptized people<br/>are called to make Christ known as Savior and Lord, and to<br/>share in the renewing of his world.  Now you are called to<br/>work as pastor, priest, and teacher, together with your<br/>bishop and fellow presbyters, and to take your share in the<br/>councils of the Church.</p>
<p>As a priest, it will be your task to proclaim by word and deed<br/>the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and to fashion your life in<br/>accordance with its precepts.  You are to love and serve the<br/>people among whom you work, caring alike for young and<br/>old, strong and weak, rich and poor. You are to preach, to<br/>declare God's forgiveness to penitent sinners, to pronounce<br/>God's blessing, to share in the administration of Holy<br/>Baptism and in the celebration of the mysteries of Christ's<br/>Body and Blood, and to perform the other ministrations<br/>entrusted to you.</p>
<p>In all that you do, you are to nourish Christ's people from the<br/>riches of his grace, and strengthen them to glorify God in this<br/>life and in the life to come.</p>
<p>My <i>brother</i>, do you believe that you are truly called by God<br/>and his Church to this priesthood?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>  I believe I am so called.</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>  Do you now in the presence of the Church commit<br/>yourself to this trust and responsibility?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>  I do.</p>
