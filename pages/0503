<p>The God of peace, who brought again from the dead our<br/>Lord Jesus Christ, the great Shepherd of the sheep, through<br/>the blood of the eternal covenant: Make you perfect in<br/>every good work to do his will, working in you that which is<br/>well-pleasing in his sight; through Jesus Christ, to whom be<br/>glory for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<h1>The Consecration of a Grave</h1>
<p><i>If the grave is in a place that has not previously been set apart for<br/>Christian burial, the Priest may use the following prayer, either before<br/>the service of Committal or at some other time.</i></p>
<p>O God, whose blessed Son was laid in a sepulcher in the<br/>garden: Bless, we pray, this grave, and grant that <i>he</i> whose<br/>body is (is to be) buried here may dwell with Christ in<br/>paradise, and may come to your heavenly kingdom; through<br/>your Son Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<h1>Additional Prayers</h1>
<p>Almighty God, with whom still live the spirits of those who<br/>die in the Lord, and with whom the souls of the faithful are in<br/>joy and felicity: We give you heartfelt thanks for the good<br/>examples of all your servants, who, having finished their<br/>course in faith, now find rest and refreshment.  May we, with<br/>all who have died in the true faith of your holy Name, have<br/>perfect fulfillment and bliss in your eternal and everlasting<br/>glory; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
