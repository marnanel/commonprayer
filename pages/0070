<p>O God, who art the life of all who live, the light of the faithful,<br/>the strength of those who labor, and the repose of the dead:<br/>We thank thee for the timely blessings of the day, and humbly<br/>beseech thy merciful protection all the night.  Bring us, we<br/>pray thee, in safety to the morning hours; through him who<br/>died for us and rose again, thy Son our Savior Jesus Christ.<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>A Collect for the Presence of Christ</i></p>
<p>Lord Jesus, stay with us, for evening is at hand and the day<br/>is past; be our companion in the way, kindle our hearts, and<br/>awaken hope, that we may know thee as thou art revealed in<br/>Scripture and the breaking of bread.  Grant this for the sake<br/>of thy love.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
