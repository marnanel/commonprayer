<h1>Note:</h1>
<p><i>The liturgy for the dead is an Easter liturgy.  It finds all meaning in<br/>the resurrection.  Because Jesus was raised from the dead, we too, shall<br/>be raised.</i></p>
<p><i>The liturgy, therefore, is characterized by joy, in the certainty that<br/>"neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things<br/>present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor<br/>anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love<br/>of God in Christ Jesus our Lord."</i></p>
<p><i>This joy, however, does not make human grief unchristian.  The very<br/>love we have for each other in Christ brings deep sorrow when we are<br/>parted by death.  Jesus himself wept at the grave of his friend.  So,<br/>while we rejoice that one we love has entered into the nearer presence<br/>of our Lord, we sorrow in sympathy with those who mourn.</i></p>
