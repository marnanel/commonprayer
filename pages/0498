Give us, we pray, the faith to follow where you have led<br/>the way; and where you live and reign with the Father and the Holy<br/>Spirit, to the ages of ages.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p><i>Preface of the Commemoration of the Dead</i></p>
<p><i>In place of the usual postcommunion prayer, the following is said</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, we thank you that in your great love you have<br/>fed us with the spiritual food and drink of the Body and<br/>Blood of your Son Jesus Christ, and have given us a foretaste<br/>of your heavenly banquet. Grant that this Sacrament may be<br/>to us a comfort in affliction, and a pledge of our inheritance<br/>in that kingdom where there is no death, neither sorrow nor<br/>crying, but the fullness of joy with all your saints; through<br/>Jesus Christ our Savior.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
