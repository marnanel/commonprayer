<p>O Lord Jesus Christ, you became poor for our sake, that we<br/>might be made rich through your poverty:  Guide and sanctify,<br/>we pray, those whom you call to follow you under the vows<br/>of poverty, chastity, and obedience, that by their prayer and<br/>service they may enrich your Church, and by their life and<br/>worship may glorify your Name; for you reign with the Father<br/>and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
