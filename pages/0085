<p><i>Especially suitable for use in Easter Season</i></p>
<p>I will sing to the Lord, for he is lofty and uplifted; *<br/> the horse and its rider has he hurled into the sea.</p>
<p>The Lord is my strength and my refuge; *<br/> the Lord has become my Savior.</p>
<p>This is my God and I will praise him, *<br/> the God of my people and I will exalt him.</p>
<p>The Lord is a mighty warrior; *<br/> Yahweh is his Name.</p>
<p>The chariots of Pharoah and his army has he hurled into the sea; *<br/> the finest of those who bear armor have been<br/>  drowned in the Red Sea.</p>
<p>The fathomless deep has overwhelmed them; *<br/> they sank into the depths like a stone.</p>
<p>Your right hand, O Lord, is glorious in might; *<br/> your right hand, O Lord, has overthrown the enemy.</p>
<p>Who can be compared with you, O Lord, among the gods? *<br/> who is like you, glorious in holiness,<br/> awesome in renown, and worker of wonders?</p>
<p>You stretched forth your right hand; *<br/> the earth swallowed them up.</p>
<p>With your constant love you led the people you redeemed; *<br/> with your might you brought them in safety to<br/>  your holy dwelling.</p>
<p>You will bring them in and plant them *<br/> on the mount of your possession,</p>
<p>The resting-place you have made for yourself, O Lord, *<br/> the sanctuary, O Lord, that your hand has established.</p>
<p>The Lord shall reign *<br/> for ever and for ever.</p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br/> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.</p>
