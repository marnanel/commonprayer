<p>Seek him that made the Pleides and Orion, that turneth deep<br/>darkness into the morning, and darkeneth the day into night;<br/>that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out<br/>upon the face of the earth:  The Lord is his Name.  <i><a href="bible:Amos+5%3A8">Amos 5:8</a></i></p>
<p>If I say, "Surely the darkness will cover me, and the light<br/>around me turn to night," darkness is not dark to thee, O Lord;<br/>the night is as bright as the day; darkness and light to thee<br/>are both alike.  <i><a href="bible:Psalm+139%3A10%2C11">Psalm 139:10,11</a></i></p>
<p>Jesus said, "I am the light of the world; he that followeth me<br/>shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."<br/><i><a href="bible:John+8%3A12">John 8:12</a></i></p>
<p>*The following Confession of Sin may then be said; or the Office may<br/>continue at once with "O God make speed to save us."</p>
<h1>Confession of Sin</h1>
<p><i>The Officiant says to the people</i></p>
<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God,<br/>let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts<br/>confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his<br/>infinite goodness and mercy.</p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>Let us humbly confess our sins unto Almighty God.</p>
<p><i>Silence may be kept.</i></p>
<p><i>Officiant and People together, all kneeling</i></p>
<p>Almighty and most merciful Father,<br/>we have erred and strayed from thy ways like lost sheep,<br/>we have followed too much the devices and desires of our<br/>  own hearts,</p>
