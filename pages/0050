<h1>Canticle 3</h1>  The Song of Mary  <i>Magnificat</i>
<p><i><a href="bible:Luke+1%3A46-55">Luke 1:46-55</a></i></p>
<p>My soul doth magnify the Lord, *<br/> and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Savior.</p>
<p>For he hath regarded *<br/> the lowliness of his handmaiden.</p>
<p>For behold from henceforth *<br/> all generations shall call me blessed.</p>
<p>For he that is mighty hath magnified me, *<br/> and holy is his Name.</p>
<p>And his mercy is on them that fear him *<br/> throughout all generations.</p>
<p>He hath showed strength with his arm; *<br/> he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</p>
<p>He hath put down the mighty from their seat, *<br/> and hath exalted the humble and meek.</p>
<p>He hath filled the hungry with good things, *<br/> and the rich he hath sent empty away.</p>
<p>He remembering his mercy hath holpen his servant Israel, *<br/> as he promised to our forefathers,<br/> Abraham and his seed for ever.</p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br/> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.</p>

<p>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, *<br/> for he hath visited and redeemed his people;</p>
<p>And hath raised up a mighty salvation for us *<br/> in the house of his servant David,</p>
<p>As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, *<br/> which have been since the world began:</p>
