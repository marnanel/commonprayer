<p>Merciful God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who is the<br/>Resurrection and the Life: Raise us, we humbly pray, from<br/>the death of sin to the life of righteousness; that when we<br/>depart this life we may rest in him, and at the resurrection<br/>receive that blessing which your well-beloved Son shall then<br/>pronounce: "Come, you blessed of my Father, receive the<br/>kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world."<br/>Grant this, O merciful Father, through Jesus Christ, our<br/>Mediator and Redeemer.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>Grant, O Lord, to all who are bereaved the spirit of faith and<br/>courage, that they may have strength to meet the days to<br/>come with steadfastness and patience; not sorrowing as those<br/>without hope, but in thankful remembrance of your great<br/>goodness, and in the joyful expectation of eternal life with<br/>those they love.  And this we ask in the Name of Jesus Christ<br/>our Savior.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, Father of mercies and giver of comfort: Deal<br/>graciously, we pray, with all who mourn; that, casting all<br/>their care on you, they may know the consolation of your<br/>love; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <i>Amen.</i></p>
