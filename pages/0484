<p>Into paradise may the angels lead thee; and at thy coming<br/>may the martyrs receive thee, and bring thee into the holy<br/>city Jerusalem.</p>
<p><i>or one of these Canticles</i></p>

<h1>The Committal</h1>
<p><i>The following anthem is sung or said</i></p>
<p>In the midst of life we are in death;<br/>of whom may we seek for succor,<br/>but of thee, O Lord,<br/>who for our sins art justly displeased?</p>
<p>Yet, O Lord God most holy, O Lord most mighty,<br/>O holy and most merciful Savior,<br/>deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal death.</p>
<p>Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts;<br/>shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer;<br/>but spare us, Lord most holy, O God most mighty,<br/>O holy and merciful Savior,<br/>thou most worthy Judge eternal.<br/>Suffer us not, at our last hour,<br/>through any pains of death, to fall from thee.</p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>All that the Father giveth me shall come to me;<br/>and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.</p>
