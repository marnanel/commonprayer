<p><i>When desired, deacons may be appointed to carry the Sacrament and<br/>minister Holy Communion to those communicants who, because of sickness<br/>or other grave cause, could not be present at the ordination.</i></p>
<p><i>If the remaining Elements are not required for the Communion of the<br/>absent, it is appropriate for the deacons to remove the vessels from the<br/>Altar, consume the remaining Elements, and cleanse the vessels in some<br/>convenient place.</i></p>
