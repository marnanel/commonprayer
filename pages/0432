<p>O God, the giver of all that is true and lovely and gracious:<br/>We give you thanks for binding us together in these holy<br/>mysteries of the Body and Blood of your Son Jesus Christ.<br/>Grant that by your Holy Spirit, <b><span class="person">N</span></b> and <b><span class="person">N</span></b>, now joined in Holy<br/>Matrimony, may become one in heart and soul, live in fidelity<br/>and peace, and obtain those eternal joys prepared for all who<br/>love you; for the sake of Jesus Christ our Lord. <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>As the wedding party leaves the church, a hymn, psalm, or anthem may be<br/>sung, or instrumental music may be played.</i></p>
