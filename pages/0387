<p>Father, we pray for your holy Catholic Church;<br/><i>That we all may be one.</i></p>
<p>Grant that every member of the Church may truly and<br/>humbly serve you;<br/><i>That your Name may be glorified by al people.</i></p>
<p>We pray for all bishops, priests, and deacons;<br/><i>That they may be faithful ministers of your Word and<br/>Sacraments.</i></p>
<p>We pray for all who govern and hold authority in the nations<br/>of the world;<br/><i>That there may be justice and peace on the earth.</i></p>
<p>Give us grace to do your will in all that we undertake;<br/><i>That our works may find favor in your sight.</i></p>
<p>Have compassion on those who suffer from any grief or trouble;<br/><i>That they may be delivered from their distress.</i></p>
<p>Give to the departed eternal rest.<br/><i>Let light perpetual shine upon them.</i></p>
<p>We praise you for your saints who have entered into joy;<br/><i>May we also come to share in your heavenly kingdom.</i></p>
<p>Let us pray for our own needs and those of others.</p>
