<p>another, so that our lives are sustained and sanctified for<br/>your service.</p>
<p><i>The Rector or Minister in charge continues</i></p>
<p>Holy Spirit, open our eyes, our ears, and our hearts, that we<br/>may grow closer to you through joy and through suffering.<br/>Be with us in the fullness of your power as new members are<br/>added to your household, as we grow in grace through the<br/>years, when we are joined in marriage, when we turn to you<br/>in sickness or special need, and, at the last, when we are<br/>committed into the Father's hands.</p>
<p><i>The Bishop concludes</i></p>
<p>Now, O Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,<br/>sanctify this place;</p>
<p><i>People</i>  For everything in heaven and on earth is yours.</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>  Yours, O Lord, is the kingdom;</p>
<p><i>People</i>  And you are exalted as head over all.  Amen.</p>
<p><i>The Bishop moves to the Font, lays a hand upon it, and says</i></p>
<p>Father, we thank you that through the waters of Baptism we<br/>die to sin and are made new in Christ.  Grant through your Spirit<br/>that those baptized here may enjoy the liberty and<br/>splendor of the children of God.</p>
<p><b><span class="person">V</span></b>  There is one Lord, one Faith, or Baptism;</p>
<p><b><span class="person">R</span></b>  One God and Father of all.</p>
<p>We dedicate this Font in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of<br/>the Holy Spirit.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>If there are persons to be baptized, water is now poured into the Font,<br/>and the service continues as directed on page <a href="575.html">575</a>.</i></p>
