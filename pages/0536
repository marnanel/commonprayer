<p><i>Concerning the Service</i></p>
<p><i>When a bishop is to confer Holy Orders, at least two presbyters must be<br/>present.</i></p>
<p><i>From the beginning of the service until the Offertory, the bishop<br/>presides from a chair placed close to the people, and facing them, so<br/>that all may see and hear what is done.</i></p>
<p><i>The ordinand is to be vested in surplice or alb, without stole, tippet,<br/>or other vesture distinctive of ecclesiastical or academic or order.</i></p>
<p><i>When the ordinand is presented, <i>his</i> full name (designated by the<br/>symbol <b><span class="person">N</span></b><b><span class="person">N</span></b>) is used.  Thereafter, it is appropriate to refer to <i>him</i><br/>only by the Christian name by which <i>he</i> wishes to be known.</i></p>
<p><i>At the Offertory, it is appropriate that the bread and wine be brought<br/>to the Altar by the family and friends of the newly ordained.</i></p>
<p><i>After receiving Holy Communion, the new deacon assists in the<br/>distribution of the Sacrament, ministering either the Bread or the Wine,<br/>or both.</i></p>
<p><i>The family of the newly ordained may receive Communion before other<br/>members of the congregation.  Opportunity is always given to the people<br/>to communicate.</i></p>
