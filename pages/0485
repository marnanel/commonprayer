<p>He that raised up Jesus from the dead<br/>will also give life to our mortal bodies,<br/>by his Spirit that dwelleth in us.</p>
<p>Wherefore my heart is glad, and my spirit rejoiceth;<br/>my flesh also shall rest in hope.</p>
<p>Thou shalt show me the path of life;<br/>in thy presence is the fullness of joy,<br/>and at thy right hand there is pleasure for evermore.</p>
<p><i>Then, while earth is cast upon the coffin, the Celebrant says these<br/>words</i></p>
<p>In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life<br/>through our Lord Jesus Christ, we commend to Almighty<br/>God our <i>brother</i> <b><span class="person">N</span></b>; and we commit <i>his</i> body to the ground;**<br/>earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.  The Lord bless<br/><i>him</i> and keep <i>him</i>, the Lord make his face to shine upon <i>him</i><br/>and be gracious unto <i>him</i>, the Lord lift up his countenance<br/>upon <i>him</i> and give <i>him</i> peace.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>** <i>Or</i> the deep, <i>or</i> the elements, <i>or</i> its resting place.</p>
<p><i>The Celebrant says</i></p>
<p>The Lord be with you.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  And with thy spirit.</p>
<p><i>Celebrant</i>  Let us pray.</p>
<p><i>Celebrant and People</i></p>
<p>Our Father, who art in heaven,<br/> hallowed be thy Name,<br/> thy kingdom come,<br/> thy will be done,<br/>  on earth as it is in heaven.<br/>Give us this day our daily bread.</p>
