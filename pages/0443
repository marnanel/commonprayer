<h1><a href="bible:Psalm+23">Psalm 23</a></h1>
<p>The LORD is my shepherd; *<br/> I shall not be in want.</p>
<p>He makes me lie down in green pastures *<br/> and leads me beside still waters.</p>
<p>He revives my soul *<br/> and guides me along right pathways for his Name's sake.</p>
<p>Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,<br/>I shall fear no evil; *<br/> for you are with me;<br/> your rod and your staff, they comfort me.</p>
<p>You spread a table before me in the presence of those<br/>  who trouble me; *<br/> you have anointed my head with oil,<br/> and my cup is running over.</p>
<p>Surely your goodness and mercy shall follow me all the<br/>days of my life, *<br/> and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.</p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br/> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.</p>
<p><i>The Celebrant then says this prayer</i></p>
<p>Let us pray.</p>
<p>O God, you have taught us through your blessed Son that<br/>whoever receives a little child in the name of Christ receives<br/>Christ himself: We give thanks for the blessing you have<br/>bestowed upon this family in giving them a child.  Confirm<br/>their joy by a lively sense of your presence with them, and<br/>give them calm strength and patient wisdom as they seek to<br/>bring this child to love all that is true and noble, just and<br/>pure, lovable and gracious, excellent and admirable,<br/>following the example of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>
