<p>whole heart and mind to praise you, the invisible,<br/>almighty, and eternal God, and your only-begotten Son,<br/>Jesus Christ our Lord; for he is the true Paschal Lamb, who<br/>at the feast of the Passover paid for us the debt of Adam's sin,<br/>and by his blood delivered your faithful people.</p>
<p>This is the night, when you brought our fathers, the children<br/>of Israel, out of bondage in Egypt, and led them through the<br/>Red Sea on dry land.</p>
<p>This is the night, when all who believe in Christ are delivered<br/>from the gloom of sin, and are restored to grace and holiness<br/>of life.</p>
<p>This is the night, when Christ broke the bonds of death and hell, and<br/>rose victorious from the grave.</p>
<p>[[How wonderful and beyond our knowing, O God, is your<br/>mercy and loving-kindness to us, that to redeem a slave, you<br/>gave a Son.]]</p>
<p>[[How holy is this night, when wickedness is put to flight, and<br/>sin is washed away.  It restores innocence to the fallen, and joy<br/>to those who mourn.  It casts out pride and hatred, and brings<br/>peace and concord.]]</p>
<p>[[How blessed is this night, when earth and heaven are joined<br/>and man is reconciled to God.]]</p>
<p>Holy Father, accept our evening sacrifice, the offering of this<br/>candle in your honor.  May it shine continually to drive away<br/>all darkness. May Christ, the Morning Star who knows no<br/>setting, find it ever burning&mdash;he who gives his light to all<br/>creation, and who lives and reigns for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>It is customary that the Paschal Candle burn at all services from<br/>Easter Day through the Day of Pentecost.</i></p>
