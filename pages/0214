<h1>Second Sunday after Christmas Day</h1>
<p>O God, who wonderfully created, and yet more wonderfully<br/>restored, the dignity of human nature:  Grant that we may<br/>share the divine life of him who humbled himself to share<br/>our humanity, you Son Jesus Christ; who lives and reigns<br/>with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever<br/>and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<h1>The Epiphany</h1>  <i>January 6</i>
<p>O God, by the leading of a star you manifested your only Son<br/>to the Peoples of the earth:  Lead us, who know you now by<br/>faith, to your presence, where we may see your glory face to<br/>face; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns<br/>with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>

<h1>First Sunday after the Epiphany:  The Baptism of our Lord</h1>
<p>Father in heaven, who at the baptism of Jesus in the River<br/>Jordan proclaimed him your beloved Son and anointed him<br/>with the Holy Spirit:  Grant that all who are baptized into his<br/>Name may keep the covenant they have made, and boldly<br/>confess him as Lord and Savior; who with you and the Holy<br/>Spirit lives and reigns, one God, in glory everlasting. <i>Amen.</i></p>
