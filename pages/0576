<p><i>As the furnishings in the church are dedicated, they may be decorated<br/>by members of the congregation with flowers, candles, hangings, or other<br/>ornaments.</i></p>
<p><i>Selected verses of psalms and hymns, or instrumental music may be used<br/>as the ministers move from one part of the church to another.</i></p>
<p><i>If one reading stand is to serve as both lectern and pulpit, only one<br/>of the prayers, and one of the versicles and responses, are used,<br/>followed by the words of dedication.</i></p>
<p><i>At the dedication of the lectern, the Bible is brought forward and put<br/>into place by a donor, or a lay reader, or another suitable person.</i></p>
<p><i>If there is an address instead of a sermon, it is suitable that a<br/>warden or other lay person outline the plans of the congregation for<br/>witness to the Gospel.  The bishop may respond, indicating the place of<br/>this congregation within the life of the Diocese.</i></p>
<p><i>The sermon or address may be followed by an appropriate Pastoral<br/>Office, such as Thanksgiving for the Birth or Adoption of a child,<br/>Commitment to Christian Service, or Blessing of Oil for the Sick.</i></p>
<p><i>Any of the usual forms of the Prayers of the People may be used; or<br/>some other form may be composed for the occasion, having due regard for<br/>the distinctive nature of the community, and with commemoration of<br/>benefactors, donors, artists, artisans, and others.</i></p>
<p><i>For the covering and decoration of the Altar, it is suitable that the<br/>donors of these furnishings, or other lay persons, bring them forward<br/>and put them in place.  If incense is to be used, it is appropriate at<br/>this time.</i></p>
<p><i>Instead of the Proper Preface suggested, that of the season may be<br/>used, or one appropriate to the name of the church.</i></p>
<p><i>For the Dedication of Churches<br/>and Chapels in Special Cases</i></p>
<p><i>If the place of worship is also to serve as a school or parish hall, or<br/>for some other suitable purpose, the service may be adapted to the<br/>circumstances.</i></p>
