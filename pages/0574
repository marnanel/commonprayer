<p>Lord God, hear us.  Sanctify this Table dedicated to you.  Let<br/>it be to us a sign of the heavenly Altar where you saints and<br/>angels praise you for ever.  Accept here the continual recalling<br/>of the sacrifice of your Son.  Grant that all who eat and drink<br/>at this holy Table may be fed and refreshed by his flesh and<br/>blood, be forgiven for their sins, united with one another, and<br/>strengthened for your service.<br/><i>Blessed be your Name, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; now<br/>and for endless ages.  Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>Bells may now be rung and music played.  Members of the congregation<br/>vest the Altar, place the vessels on it, and light the candles.</i></p>
<h1>The Peace</h1>
<p><i>The Bishop says to the people</i></p>
<p>The peace of the Lord be always with you.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  And also with you.</p>
<p><i>Then the bishop and other clergy and the people greet one another.</i></p>
<h1>At the Eucharist</h1>
<p><i>The service continues with the Offertory.</i></p>
<p><i>The bishop, or a priest appointed, is the chief celebrant.</i></p>
<p><i>The Preface of the Dedication of a Church may be used.</i></p>
<p><i>After the postcommunion prayer, the Bishop blesses the people; and a<br/>Deacon or Priest dismisses them.</i></p>
