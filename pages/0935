<p><i>Brackets and parentheses are used (brackets in the case of whole<br/>Psalms, parentheses in the case of verses) to indicate Psalms and verses<br/>of Psalms which may be omitted.  In some instances, the entire portion<br/>of the Psalter assigned to a given Office has been bracketed, and<br/>alternative Psalmody provided.  Those who desire to recite the Psalter<br/>in its entirety should, in each instance, use the bracketed Psalms<br/>rather than the alternatives.</i></p>
<p><i>Antiphons drawn from the Psalms themselves, or from the opening<br/>sentences given in the Offices, or from other passages of Scripture, may<br/>be used with the Psalms and biblical Canticles.  The antiphons may be<br/>sung or said at the beginning and end of each Psalm or Canticle, or may<br/>be used as refrains after each verse or group of verses.</i></p>
<p><i>On Special Occasions, the officiant may select suitable Psalms and<br/>Readings.</i></p>
