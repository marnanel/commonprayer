<p>My heart hath talked of thee, Seek ye my face. *<br/>  Thy face, LORD, will I seek.</p>
<p>O hide not thou thy face from me, *<br/> nor cast thy servant away in displeasure.</p>
<p>I should utterly have fainted, *<br/> but that I believe verily to see the goodness of the LORD in<br/>  the land of the living.</p>
<p>O tarry thou the LORD's leisure; *<br/> be strong, and he shall comfort thine heart;<br/> and put thou thy trust in the LORD.</p>
<h1><a href="bible:Psalm+106">Psalm 106</a></h1>  <i>Confitemini Domino</i>
<p>O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is gracious, *<br/> and his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>Who can express the noble acts of the LORD, *<br/> or show forth all his praise?</p>
<p>Blessed are they that alway keep judgment, *<br/> and do righteousness.</p>
<p>Remember me, O LORD, according to the favor that thou<br/>  bearest unto thy people; *<br/> O visit me with thy salvation.</p>
<p>That I may see the felicity of thy chosen, *<br/> and rejoice in the gladness of thy people,<br/> and give thanks with thine inheritance.</p>
<h1><a href="bible:Psalm+116">Psalm 116</a></h1>  <i>Dilexi, quoniam</i>
<p>My delight is in the LORD, *<br/> because he hath heard the voice of my prayer;</p>
