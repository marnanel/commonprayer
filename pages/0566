<p><i>Concerning the Service</i></p>
<p><i>This service provides for the dedication and consecration of a church<br/>and its furnishings.  Portions of the service may be used, or adapted<br/>when necessary, for dedicating parts of a building, or furnishings, that<br/>have been added, altered, or renovated.  Likewise, suitable parts of<br/>this rite may be used for dedicating a chapel or an oratory within<br/>another building.  Provisions for adapting the rite to special<br/>circumstances are given on page <a href="576.html">576</a>.</i></p>
<p><i>This service may be used to dedicate and consecrate a church at any<br/>time after the building is ready for use as a place of worship.</i></p>
<p><i>The service does not preclude the use of the building for educational<br/>or social purposes, or for other suitable activities.</i></p>
<p><i>The bishop presides.  The rector or minister in charge takes part as<br/>indicated.  Neighboring ministers should be invited to participate, and<br/>may be assigned appropriate parts in the service.</i></p>
<p><i>It is desirable that all members of the congregation, young and old,<br/>have some individual or collective part in the celebration, as well as<br/>the architect, builders, musicians, artists, benefactors, and friends.</i></p>
<p><i>For a church or chapel long in use, a special order is provided on page<br/>577.</i></p>
<p><i>Additional Directions are on page <a href="575.html">575</a>.</i></p>
