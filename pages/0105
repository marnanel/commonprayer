<p>8  The LORD shall watch over your going out and your coming in, *<br/> from this time forth for evermore.</p>
<h1><a href="bible:Psalm+126">Psalm 126</a></h1>  <i>In convertendo</i>
<p>1  When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, *<br/> then were we like those who dream.</p>
<p>2  Then was our mouth filled with laughter, *<br/> and our tongue with shouts of joy.</p>
<p>3  Then they said among the nations, *<br/> "The LORD has done great things for them."</p>
<p>4  The LORD has done great things for us, *<br/> and we are glad indeed.</p>
<p>5  Restore our fortunes, O LORD, *<br/> like the watercourses of the Negev.</p>
<p>6  Those who sowed with tears *<br/> will reap with songs of joy.</p>
<p>7  Those who go out weeping, carrying the seed, *<br/> will come again with joy, shouldering their sheaves.</p>
<p><i>At the end of the Psalms is sung or said</i></p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br/> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.</p>
