<p>season of penitence and fasting.  This is season of Lent<br/>provided a time in which converts to the faith were prepared for Holy<br/>Baptism.  It was also a time when those who, because of<br/>notorious sins, had been separated from the body of the faithful<br/>were reconciled by penitence and forgiveness, and restored to<br/>the fellowship of the Church. Thereby, the whole congregation<br/>was put in mind of the message of pardon and absolution set<br/>forth in the Gospel of our Savior, and of the need which all<br/>Christians continually have to renew their repentance and faith.</p>
<p>I invite you, therefore, in the name of the Church, to the<br/>observance of a holy Lent, by self-examination and repentance;<br/>by prayer, fasting, and self-denial; and by reading and<br/>meditating on God's holy Word.  And, to make a right beginning<br/>of repentance, and as a mark of our mortal nature, let us now<br/>kneel before the Lord, our maker and redeemer.</p>
<p>*Silence is then kept for a time, all kneeling.</p>
<p>[[<i>If ashes are to be imposed, the Celebrant says the following prayer</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, you have created us out of the dust of the<br/>earth:  Grant that these ashes may be to us a sign of our<br/>mortality and penitence, that we may remember that it is<br/>only by your gracious gift that we are given everlasting life;<br/>through Jesus Christ our Savior.   <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>The ashes are imposed with the following words</i></p>
<p>Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return.]]</p>
<p><i>The following Psalm is then sung or said</i></p>
