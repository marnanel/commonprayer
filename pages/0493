<p>The Lord be with you.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  And also with you.</p>
<p><i>Celebrant</i> Let us pray.</p>
<p><i>Silence may be kept; after which the Celebrant says one of the<br/>following Collects</i></p>
<p><i>At the Burial of an Adult</i></p>
<p>O God, who by the glorious resurrection of your Son Jesus<br/>Christ destroyed death, and brought life and immortality to<br/>light: Grant that your servant <b><span class="person">N</span></b>, being raised with him, may<br/>know the strength of his presence, and rejoice in his eternal<br/>glory; who with you and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns, one God, for<br/>ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>O God, whose mercies cannot be numbered: Accept our<br/>prayers on behalf of your servant <b><span class="person">N</span></b>, and grant <i>him</i> an<br/>entrance into the land of light and joy, in the fellowship of<br/>your saints; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and<br/>reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for<br/>ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>O God of grace and glory, we remember before you this day<br/>our brother (sister) <b><span class="person">N</span></b>  We thank you for giving <i>him</i> to us, <i>his</i><br/>family and friends, to know and to love as a companion on<br/>our earthly pilgrimage. In your boundless compassion,<br/>console us who mourn.  Give us faith to see in death the gate<br/>of eternal life, so that in quiet confidence we may continue<br/>our course on earth, until, by your call, we are reunited with<br/>those who have gone before; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <i>Amen.</i></p>
