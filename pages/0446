<h1>Concerning the Rite</h1>
<p><i>The ministry of reconciliation, which has been committed by Christ to<br/>his Church, is exercised through the care each Christian has for others,<br/>through the common prayer of Christians assembled for public worship,<br/>and through the priesthood of Christ and his ministers declaring<br/>absolution.</i></p>
<p><i>The Reconciliation of a Penitent is available for all who desire it. It<br/>is not restricted to times of sickness.  Confessions may be heard<br/>anytime and anywhere.</i></p>
<p><i>Two equivalent forms of service are provided here to meet the needs of<br/>penitents.  The absolution in these services may be pronounced only by a<br/>bishop or priest.  Another Christian may be asked to hear a confession,<br/>but it must be made clear to the penitent that absolution will not be<br/>pronounced; instead, a declaration of forgiveness is provided.</i></p>
<p><i>When a confession is heard in a church building, the confessor may sit<br/>inside the altar rails or in a place set aside to give greater privacy,<br/>and the penitent kneels nearby.  If preferred, the confessor and<br/>penitent may sit face to face for a spiritual conference leading to<br/>absolution or a declaration of forgiveness.</i></p>
<p><i>When the penitent has confessed all serious sins troubling the<br/>conscience and has given evidence of due contrition, the priest gives<br/>such counsel and encouragement as are needed and pronounces the<br/>absolution.  Before giving absolution, the priest may assign to the<br/>penitent a psalm, prayer, or hymn to be said, or something to be done,<br/>as a sign of penitence and act of thanksgiving.</i></p>
<p><i>The content of a confession is not normally a matter of subsequent<br/>discussion.  The secrecy of a confession is morally absolute for the<br/>confessor, and must under no circumstances be broken.</i></p>
