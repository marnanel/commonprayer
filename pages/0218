<h1>First Sunday in Lent</h1>
<p>Almighty God, whose blessed Son was led by the Spirit to be<br/>tempted by Satan; Come quickly to help us who are assaulted<br/>by many temptations; and, as you know the weaknesses of<br/>each of us, let each one find you mighty to save; through<br/>Jesus Christ your Son our Lord, who lives and reigns with<br/>you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p><i>Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday of this week are the traditional spring<br/>Ember Days.</i></p>
<h1>Second Sunday in Lent</h1>
<p>O God, whose glory it is always to have mercy:  Be gracious<br/>to all who have gone astry from your ways, and bring them<br/>again with penitent hearts and steadfast faith to embrace and<br/>hold fast the unchangeable truth of your Word, Jesus Christ<br/>your Son; who with you and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns,<br/>one God, for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<h1>Third Sunday in Lent</h1>
<p>Almighty God, you know that we have no power in ourselves<br/>to help ourselves:  Keep us both outwardly in our bodies and<br/>inwardly in our souls, that we may be defended from all<br/>adversities which may happen to the body, and from all evil<br/>thoughts which may assault and hurt the soul; through Jesus<br/>Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy<br/>Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
