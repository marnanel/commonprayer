<p>*The following Confession of Sin may then be said; or the Office may<br/>continue at once with "Lord, open our lips."</p>
<h1>Confession of Sin</h1>
<p><i>The Officiant says to the people</i></p>
<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of<br/>Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to<br/>hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf<br/>of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our<br/>salvation.  And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and<br/>mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with<br/>penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may<br/>obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.</p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.</p>
<p><i>Silence may be kept.</i></p>
<p><i>Officiant and People together, all kneeling</i></p>
<p>Most merciful God,<br/>we confess that we have sinned against you<br/>in thought, word, and deed,<br/>by what we have done,<br/>and by what we have left undone.<br/>We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br/>we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br/>We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br/>For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br/>have mercy on us and forgive us;<br/>that we may delight in your will,<br/>and walk in your ways,<br/>to the glory of your Name.  Amen.</p>
