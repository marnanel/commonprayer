<h1>Concerning the Celebration</h1>
<p><i>It is the bishop's prerogative, when present, to be the principal<br/>celebrant at the Lord's Table, and to preach the Gospel.</i></p>
<p><i>At all celebrations of the Liturgy, it is fitting that the principal<br/>celebrant, whether bishop or priest, be assisted by other priests, and<br/>by deacons and lay persons.</i></p>
<p><i>It is appropriate that other priests present stand with the celebrant<br/>at the Altar, and join in the consecration of the gifts, in breaking the<br/>Bread, and in distributing Communion.</i></p>
<p><i>A deacon should read the Gospel and may lead the Prayers of the People.<br/>Deacons should also serve at the Lord's Table, preparing and placing on<br/>it the offerings of bread and wine, and assisting in the ministration of<br/>the sacrament to the people.  In the absence of a deacon, these duties<br/>may be performed by an assisting priest.</i></p>
<p><i>Lay persons appointed by the celebrant should normally be assigned the<br/>reading of the Lessons which precede the Gospel, and may lead the<br/>Prayers of the People.</i></p>
<p><i>Morning or Evening Prayer may be used in place of all that precedes the<br/>Peace and the Offertory, provided that a lesson from the Gospel is<br/>always included, and that the intercessions conform to the directions<br/>given for the Prayers of the People.</i></p>
