<p><i>Preface of the Commemoration of the Dead</i></p>
<p><i>In place of the usual postcommunion prayer, the following is said</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, we thank thee that in thy great love thou hast<br/>fed us with the spiritual food and drink of the Body and<br/>Blood of thy Son Jesus Christ, and hast given unto us a<br/>foretaste of thy heavenly banquet.  Grant that this Sacrament<br/>may be unto us a comfort in affliction, and a pledge of our<br/>inheritance in that kingdom where there is no death, neither<br/>sorrow nor crying, but the fullness of joy with all thy saints;<br/>through Jesus Christ our Savior.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>If the body is not present, the service continues with the [blessing<br/>and] dismissal.</i></p>
<p><i>Unless the Committal follows immediately in the church, the following<br/>Commendation is used.</i></p>
<h1>The Commendation</h1>
<p><i>The Celebrant and other ministers take their places at the body.</i></p>
<p><i>This anthem, or some other suitable anthem, or a hymn, may be sung or<br/>said</i></p>
<p>Give rest, O Christ, to thy servant(s) with thy saints,<br/><i>where sorrow and pain are no more,<br/>neither sighing, but life everlasting.</i></p>
<p>Thou only art immortal, the creator and maker of mankind;<br/>and we are mortal, formed of the earth, and unto earth shall<br/>we return.  For so thou didst ordain when thou createdst me,<br/>saying, "Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return."  All</p>
