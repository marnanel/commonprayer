<h1>Rules for Finding the Date of Easter Day</h1>
<p>Easter Day is always the Sunday after the full moon that occurs on or<br/>after the spring equinox on March 21, a date which is fixed in accordance<br/>with an ancient ecclesiastical computation, and which does not always<br/>correspond to the astronomical equinox.  This full moon may happen on<br/>any date between March 21 and April 18 inclusive.  If the full moon<br/>falls on a Sunday, Easter Day is the Sunday following.  But Easter Day<br/>cannot be earlier than March 22 or later than April 25.</p>
<p>To find the date of Easter Day in any particular year, it is necessary<br/>to have two points of reference&mdash;the Golden Number and the Sunday Letter<br/>for that year.</p>
<p>1.  The Golden Number indicates the date of the full moon on or after<br/>the spring equinox of March 21, according to a nineteen-year cycle.<br/>These Numbers are prefixed in the Calendar to the days of the month from<br/>March 22 to April 19 inclusive.  In the present Calendar they are<br/>applicable from A.D. 1900 to A.D. 2099, after which they will change.</p>
<p>2.  The Sunday Letter identifies the days of the year when Sundays<br/>occur.  After every date in the Calendar a letter appears&mdash;from [A] to<br/>[g].  Thus, if January 1 is a Sunday, the Sunday Letter for the Year is<br/>[A], and every date in the Calendar marked by [A] is a Sunday.  If<br/>January 2 is a Sunday, then every date marked with [b] is a Sunday, and<br/>so on through the seven letters.</p>
<p>In Leap Years, however, the Sunday Letter changes on the first day of<br/>March.  In such years, when [A] is the Sunday Letter, this applies only<br/>to Sundays in January and February, and [g] is the Sunday Letter for the<br/>rest of the year.  Or if [d] is the Sunday Letter, then [c] is the<br/>Sunday Letter on and after March 1.</p>
<h1>To Find the Golden Number</h1>
<p>The Golden Number of any year is calculated as follows:  Take the number<br/>of the year, add 1, and then divide the sum by 19.  The remainder, if<br/>any, is the Golden Number.  If nothing remains, then 19 is the Golden<br/>Number.</p>
<h1>To Find the Sunday Letter</h1>
<p>The following Table provides ready reference to the Sunday Letter of any<br/>year between  A.D. 1900 and  A.D. 2099.  It will be found on the line of<br/>the hundredth year above the column that contains the remaining digits<br/>of the year.  But in Leap Years the Letter above the number marked with<br/>an asterisk is the Sunday Letter for January and February, and the<br/>Letter over the number not so marked is the Sunday Letter for the rest<br/>of the year.</p>
