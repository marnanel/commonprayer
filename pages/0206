<h1>16. For the Mission of the Church</h1>
<p>O God, who hast made of one blood all the peoples of the<br/>earth, and sent thy blessed Son to preach peace to those<br/>who are far off and to those who are near:  Grant that people<br/>everywhere may seek after thee and find thee, bring the<br/>nations into thy fold, pour out thy Spirit upon all flesh, and<br/>hasten the coming of thy kingdom; through the same thy<br/>Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee<br/>and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>O God of all the nations of the earth:  Remember the<br/>multitudes who have been created in thine image but have<br/>not known the redeeming work of our Savior Jesus Christ;<br/>and grant that, by the prayers and labors of thy holy Church,<br/>they may be brought to know and worship thee as thou hast<br/>been revealed in thy Son; who liveth and reigneth with thee<br/>and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
