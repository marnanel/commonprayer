<h1>Christ our Passover</h1>  <i>Pascha nostrum</i>
<p><i><a href="bible:1+Corinthians+5%3A7-8">1 Corinthians 5:7-8</a>; <a href="bible:Romans+6%3A9-11">Romans 6:9-11</a>; <a href="bible:1+Corinthians+15%3A20-22">1 Corinthians 15:20-22</a></i></p>
<p>Alleluia.<br/>Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us; *<br/> therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
<p>Not with old leaven,<br/>neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, *<br/> but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.  Alleluia.</p>
<p>Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; *<br/> death hath no more dominion over him.</p>
<p>For in that he died, he died unto sin once; *<br/> but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.</p>
<p>Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, *<br/> but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Alleluia.</p>
<p>Christ is risen from the dead, *<br/> and become the first fruits of them that slept.</p>
<p>For since by man came death, *<br/> by man came also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
<p>For as in Adam all die, *<br/> even so in Christ shall all be made alive.  Alleluia.</p>
<p><i>Then follows</i></p>
<h1>The Psalm or Psalms Appointed</h1>
<p><i>At the end of the Psalms is sung or said</i></p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br/> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.</p>
