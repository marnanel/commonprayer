<p>All things quake with fear at your presence; *<br/> they tremble because of your power.</p>
<p>But your merciful promise is beyond all measure; *<br/> it surpasses all that our minds can fathom.</p>
<p>O Lord, you are full of compassion, *<br/> long-suffering, and abounding in mercy.</p>
<p>You hold back your hand; *<br/> you do not punish as we deserve.</p>
<p>In your great goodness, Lord,<br/>you have promised forgiveness to sinners, *<br/> that they may repent of their sin and be saved.</p>
<p>And now, O Lord, I bend the knee of my heart, *<br/> and make my appeal, sure of your gracious goodness.</p>
<p>I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, *<br/> and I know my wickedness only too well.</p>
<p>Therefore I make this prayer to you: *<br/> Forgive me, Lord, forgive me.</p>
<p>Do not let me perish in my sin, *<br/> nor condemn me to the depths of the earth.</p>
<p>For you, O Lord, are the God of those who repent, *<br/> and in me you will show forth your goodness.</p>
<p>Unworthy as I am, you will save me,<br/>in accordance with your great mercy, *<br/> and I will praise you without ceasing all the days of my life.</p>
<p>For all the powers of heaven sing your praises, *<br/> and yours is the glory to ages of ages.  Amen.</p>
