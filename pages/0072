<p><i>A Prayer of St. Chrysostom</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, who hast given us grace at this time with one<br/>accord to make our common supplication unto thee; and<br/>hast promised through thy well-beloved Son that when two<br/>or three are gathered together in his Name thou wilt be in the<br/>midst of them:  Fulfill now, O Lord, our desires and petitions<br/>of thy servants as may be best for us; granting us in this<br/>world knowledge of thy truth, and in the world to come life<br/>everlasting.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>Then may be said</i></p>
<p>Let us bless the Lord.<br/><i>Thanks be to God.</i></p>
<p><i>From Easter Day through the Day of Pentecost "Alleluia, alleluia" may<br/>be added to the preceding versicle and response.</i></p>

<p>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and<br/>the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore.<br/><i>Amen.</i>  <i><a href="bible:2+Corinthians+13%3A14">2 Corinthians 13:14</a></i></p>
