<p><i>When this action has been completed for all candidates, the Bishop or<br/>Priest, at a place in full sight of the congregation, prays over them,<br/>saying</i></p>
<p>Let us pray.</p>
<p>Heavenly Father, we thank you that by water and the Holy<br/>Spirit you have bestowed upon <i>these</i> your servants the<br/>forgiveness of sin, and have raised <i>them</i> to the new life of<br/>grace.  Sustain <i>them,</i> O Lord, in your Holy Spirit.  Give <i>them</i><br/>an inquiring and discerning heart, the courage to will and to<br/>persevere, a spirit to know and to love you, and the gift of joy<br/>and wonder in all your works.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>Then the Bishop or Priest places a hand on the person's head, marking<br/>on the forehead the sign of the cross [using Chrism if desired] and<br/>saying to each one</i></p>
<p><b><span class="person">N</span></b>, you are sealed by the Holy Spirit in Baptism and marked<br/>as Christ's own for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>Or this action may be done immediately after the administration of the<br/>water and before the preceding prayer.</i></p>
<p><i>When all have been baptized, the Celebrant says</i></p>
<p>Let us welcome the newly baptized.</p>
<p><i>Celebrant and People</i></p>
<p>We receive you into the household of God.  Confess the faith<br/>of Christ crucified, proclaim his resurrection, and share with<br/>us in his eternal priesthood.</p>
<p><i>If Confirmation, Reception, or the Reaffirmation of Baptismal Vows is<br/>not to follow, the Peace is now exchanged</i></p>
<p><i>Celebrant</i>  The peace of the Lord be always with you.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  And also with you.</p>
