<p>Almighty and everlasting God, who hatest nothing that thou<br/>hast made and dost forgive the sins of all those who are<br/>penitent:  Create and make in us new and contrite hearts, that<br/>we, worthily lamenting our sins and acknowledging our<br/>wretchedness, may obtain of thee, the God of all mercy,<br/>perfect remission and forgiveness; through Jesus Christ our<br/>Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit,<br/>one God, for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<h1>First Sunday in Lent</h1>
<p>Almighty God, whose blessed Son was led by the Spirit to be<br/>tempted by Satan; Come quickly to help us who are assaulted by many<br/>temptations; and, as you know the weaknesses of each of us, let each one<br/>find you mighty to save; through Jesus Christ thy Son our Lord, who<br/>liveth and reigneth with<br/>you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p>O God, whose glory it is always to have mercy:  Be gracious<br/>to all who have gone astray from thy ways, and bring them<br/>again with penitent hearts and steadfast faith to embrace and<br/>hold fast the unchangeable truth of thy Word, Jesus Christ</p>
