<p>Almighty God, who gave such grace to your apostle Andrew<br/>that he readily obeyed the call of your Son Jesus Christ, and<br/>brought his brother with him: Give us, who are called by<br/>your holy Word, grace to follow him withoit delay, and to<br/>bring those near to us into his gracious presence; who lives<br/>and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and<br/>for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p>Everliving God, who strengthened your apostle Thomas with<br/>firm and certain faith in your Son's resurrection: Grant us so<br/>perfectly and without doubt to believe in Jesus Christ, our<br/>Lord and our God, that our faith may never be found wanting<br/>in your sight; through him who lives and reigns with yuo and<br/>the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p>We give you thanks, O Lord of glory, for the example of<br/>the first martyr Stephen, who looked up to heaven and prayed<br/>for his persecutors to your Son Jesus Christ, who stands at<br/>your right hand; where he lives and reigns with you and the<br/>Holy Spirit, one God, in glory everlasting.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
