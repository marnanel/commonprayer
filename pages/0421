<p><i>The Celebrant then says this or some other appropriate prayer</i></p>
<p>Let us pray.</p>
<p>Almighty God, look with favor upon <i>this person</i> who <i>has</i><br/>now reaffirmed <i>his</i> commitment to follow Christ and to serve<br/>in his name. Give <i>him</i> courage, patience, and vision; and<br/>strengthen us all in our Christian vocation of witness to the<br/>world, and of service to others; through Jesus Christ our<br/>Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>A prayer for the special work in which the person will be engaged may<br/>be added.</i></p>
<p><i>The service then continues with the exchange of the Peace and the<br/>Offertory.</i></p>
