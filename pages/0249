<h1>Of a Monastic</h1>
<p>O God, whose blessed Son became poor that we through his<br/>poverty might be rich:  Deliver us from an inordinate love of<br/>this world, that we, inspired by the devotion of your servant<br/><b><span class="person">N</span></b>, may serve you with singleness of heart, and attain to the<br/>riches of the age to come; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who<br/>lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one<br/>God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>O God, by whose grace your servant <b><span class="person">N</span></b>, kindled with the<br/>flame of your love, became a burning and a shining light in<br/>your Church:  Grant that we also may be aflame with the spirit<br/>of love and discipline, and walk before you as children of light;<br/>through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you,<br/>in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>
