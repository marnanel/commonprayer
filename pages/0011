<p>But while these alterations were in review before the Convention, they<br/>could not but, with gratitude to God, embrace the happy occasion which<br/>was offered to them (uninfluenced and unrestrained by any worldly<br/>authority whatsoever) to take a further review of the Public Service,<br/>and to establish such other alterations and amendments therein as might<br/>be deemed expedient.</p>
<p>It seems unnecessary to enumerate all the different alterations and<br/>amendments.  They will appear, and it is to be hoped, the reasons of<br/>them also, upon a comparison of this with the Book of Common Prayer of<br/>the Church of England.  In which it will also appear that this Church is<br/>far from intending to depart from the Church of England in any essential<br/>point of doctrine, discipline, or worship; or further than local<br/>circumstances require.</p>
<p>And now, this important work being brought to a conclusion, it is hoped<br/>the whole will be received and examined by every true member of our<br/>Church, and every sincere Christian, with a meek, candid, and charitable<br/>frame of mind; without prejudice or prepossessions; seriously<br/>considering what Christianity is, and what the truths of the Gospel are;<br/>and earnestly beseeching Almighty God to accompany with his blessing<br/>every endeavour for promulgating them to mankind in the clearest,<br/>plainest, most affecting and majestic manner, for the sake of Jesus<br/>Christ, our blessed Lord and Saviour.</p>
