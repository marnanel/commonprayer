<p>Lift up your hearts.<br/><i>We lift them to the Lord.</i></p>
<p>Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.<br/><i>It is right to give him thanks and praise.</i></p>
<p><i>Then, facing the Holy Table, the Celebrant proceeds</i></p>
<p>God of all power, Ruler of the Universe, you are worthy of<br/>glory and praise.<br/><i>Glory to you for ever and ever.</i></p>
<p>At your command all things came to be: the vast expanse of<br/>interstellar space, galaxies, suns, the planets in their courses,<br/>and this fragile earth, our island home.<br/><i>By your will they were created and have their being.</i></p>
<p>From the primal elements you brought forth the human race,<br/>and blessed us with memory, reason, and skill.  You made us<br/>the rulers of creation.  But we turned against you, and betrayed<br/>your trust; and we turned against one another.<br/><i>Have mercy, Lord, for we are sinners in your sight.</i></p>
<p>Again and again, you called us to return.  Through prophets<br/>and sages you revealed your righteous Law.  And in the<br/>fullness of time you sent you only Son, born of a woman, to<br/>fulfill your Law, to open for is the way of freedom and peace.<br/><i>By his blood, he reconciled us.<br/>By his wounds, we are healed.</i></p>
<p>And therefore we praise you, joining with the heavenly<br/>chorus, with prophets, apostles, and martyrs, and with all<br/>those in every generation who have looked to you in hope, to<br/>proclaim with them your glory, in their unending hymn:</p>
