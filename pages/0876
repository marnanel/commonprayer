<p><i>ministering either of God's Word, or of the Sacraments, the which thing<br/>the Injunctions also lately set forth by Elizabeth our Queen do most<br/>plainly testify; but that only prerogative, which we see to have been<br/>given always to all godly Princes in holy Scriptures by God himself;<br/>that is, that they should rule all estates and degrees committed to<br/>their charge by God, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Temporal, and<br/>restrain with the civil sword the stubborn and evil-doers.</i></p>
<p><i>The Bishop of Rome hath no jurisdiction in this Realm of England.</i></p>
<p><i>The Laws of the Realm may punish Christian men with death, for heinous<br/>and grievous offenses.</i></p>
<p><i>It is lawful for Christian men, at the commandment of the Magistrate,<br/>to wear weapons, and serve in the wars.</i></p>
<h1>XXXVIII.  Of Christian Men's Goods, which are not common.</h1>
<p>The Riches and Goods of Christians are not common, as touching the<br/>right, title, and possession of the same; as certain Anabaptists do<br/>falsely boast.  Notwithstanding, every man ought, of such things as he<br/>possesseth, liberally to give alms to the poor, according to his<br/>ability.</p>

<h1>The Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral 1886, 1888</h1>
<p><i>Adopted by the House of Bishops<br/>Chicago, 1886</i></p>
<p>We, Bishops of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of<br/>America, in Council assembled as Bishops in the Church of God, do hereby<br/>solemnly declare to all whom it may concern, and especially to our<br/>fellow-Christians of the different Communions in this land, who, in<br/>their several spheres, have contended for the religion of Christ:</p>
<p>1.  Our earnest desire that the Savior's prayer, "That we all may be<br/>one," may, in its deepest and truest sense, be speedily fulfilled;</p>
<p>2.  That we believe that all who have been duly baptized with water,<br/>in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, are<br/>members of the Holy Catholic Church.</p>
<p>3.  That in all things of human ordering or human choice, relating to<br/>modes of worship and discipline, or to traditional customs, this Church<br/>is ready in the spirit of love and humility to forego all preferences of<br/>her own;</p>
