<h1>The Holy Name</h1>  <i>January 1</i>
<p>Eternal Father, who didst give to thine incarnate Son the holy<br/>name of Jesus to be the sign of our salvation:  Plant in every<br/>heart, we beseech thee, the love of him who is the Savior of<br/>the world, even our Lord Jesus Christ; who liveth<br/>and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, in glory<br/>everlasting.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<h1>Second Sunday after Christmas Day</h1>
<p>O God, who didst wonderfully creat, and yet more<br/>wonderfully restore, the dignity of human nature:  Grant<br/>that we may share the divine life of him who humbled<br/>himself to share our humanity, thy Son Jesus Christ; who<br/>liveth and reigneth with thee, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br/>one God, for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
