<p>Let us pray.</p>
<p>Deliver your servant, <b><span class="person">N</span></b>, O Sovereign Lord Christ, from all<br/>evil, and set <i>him</i> free from every bond; that <i>he</i> may rest with<br/>all your saints in the eternal habitations; where with the<br/>Father and the Holy Spirit your live and reign, one God, for<br/>ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>A Commendation at the Time of Death</i></p>
<p>Depart, O Christian soul, out of this world;<br/>In the Name of God the Father Almighty who created you;<br/>In the Name of Jesus Christ who redeemed you;<br/>In the Name of the Holy Spirit who sanctifies you.<br/>May your rest be this day in peace,<br/> and your dwelling place in the Paradise of God.</p>
