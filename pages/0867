<p>and superstitious: and is ordained nothing to be read, but the very pure<br/>word of God, the holy Scriptures, or that which is evidently grounded<br/>upon the same; and that in such a language and order as is most easy and<br/>plain for the understanding, both of the readers and hearers.  It is<br/>also more commodious, both for the shortness thereof, and for the<br/>plainness of the order, and for that the rules be few and easy.<br/>Furthermore, by this order the curates shall need none other books for<br/>their public service, but this book and the Bible: by the means whereof,<br/>the people shall not be at so great charge for books, as in time past<br/>they have been.</p>
<p>And where heretofore, there hath been great diversity in saying and<br/>singing in churches within this realm: some following Salisbury use,<br/>some Hereford use, some the use of Bangor, some of York, and some of<br/>Lincoln: now from henceforth, all the whole realm shall have but one<br/>use.  And if any would judge this way more painful, because that all<br/>things must be read upon the book, whereas before, by reason of so often<br/>repetition, they could say many things by heart: if those men will weigh<br/>their labor with the profit in knowledge, which daily they shall obtain<br/>by reading upon the book, they will not refuse the pain, in<br/>consideration of the great profit that shall ensue thereof.</p>
<p>And forasmuch as nothing else, almost, be so plainly set forth, but<br/>doubts may arise in the use and practicing of the same: to appease all<br/>such diversity (if any arise), and for the resolution of all doubts,<br/>concerning the manner how to understand, do, and execute, the things<br/>contained in this book: the parties that so doubt, or diversely take any<br/>thing, shall always resort to the Bishop of the Diocese, who by his<br/>discretion shall take order for the quieting and appeasing of the same;<br/>so that the same order be not contrary to any thing contained in this<br/>book.</p>
<p>Though it be appointed in the afore written preface, that all things<br/>shall be read and sung in the church in the English tongue, to the end<br/>that the congregation may be thereby edified: yet it is not meant, but<br/>when men say Matins and Evensong privately, they may say the same in any<br/>language that they themselves do understand.  Neither that any man shall<br/>be bound to the saying of them, but such as from time to time, in<br/>Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, parish Churches, and Chapels to the<br/>same annexed, shall serve the congregation.</p>

<h1>I.  Of Faith in the Holy Trinity.</h1>
<p>There is but one living and true God, everlasting, without body, parts,<br/>or passions; of infinite power, wisdom, and goodness; the Maker, and<br/>Preserver of all things both visible and invisible.  And in the unity of<br/>this Godhead there be three Persons, of one substance, power, and<br/>eternity; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.</p>
