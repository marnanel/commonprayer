<p><i>7.  For the Diversity of Races and Cultures</i></p>
<p>O God, who created all peoples in your image, we thank you<br/>for the wonderful diversity of races and cultures in this world.<br/>Enrich our lives by ever-widening circles of fellowship, and<br/>show us your presence in those who differ most from us, until<br/>our knowledge of your love is made perfect in our love for all<br/>your children; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<h1>Thanksgivings for the Natural Order</h1>
<p><i>8.  For the Beauty of the Earth</i></p>
<p>We give you thanks, most gracious God, for the beauty of<br/>earth and sky and sea; for the richness of mountains, plains,<br/>and rivers; for the songs of birds and the loveliness of flowers.<br/>We praise you for these good gifts, and pray that we may<br/>safeguard them for our posterity.  Grant that we may continue<br/>to grow in our grateful enjoyment of your abundant creation,<br/>to the honor and glory of your Name, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>9.  For the Harvest</i></p>
<p>Most gracious God, by whose knowledge the depths are<br/>broken up and the clouds drop down the dew:  We yield thee<br/>hearty thanks and praise for the return of seed<br/>time and harvest,<br/>for the increase of the ground and the gathering in of its fruits,<br/>and for all other blessings of thy merciful providence<br/>bestowed upon this nation and people.  And, we beseech thee,<br/>give us a just sense of these great mercies, such as may appear<br/>in our lives by a humble, holy, and obedient walking before<br/>thee all our days; through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom,<br/>with thee and the Holy Ghost be all glory and honor, world<br/>without end.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
