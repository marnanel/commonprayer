<p><i>Concerning the Service</i></p>
<p><i>The death of a member of the Church should be reported as soon as<br/>possible to, and arrangements for the funeral should be made in<br/>consultation with, the Minister of the Congregation.</i></p>
<p><i>Baptized Christians are properly buried from the church.  The service<br/>should be held at a time when the congregation has opportunity to be<br/>present.</i></p>
<p><i>The coffin is to be closed before the service, and it remains closed<br/>thereafter.  It is appropriate that it be covered with a pall or other<br/>suitable covering.</i></p>
<p><i>If necessary, or if desired, all or part of the service of Committal<br/>may be said in the church.  If preferred, the Committal service may take<br/>place before the service in the church.  It may also be used prior to<br/>cremation.</i></p>
<p><i>A priest normally presides at the service.  It is appropriate that the<br/>bishop, when present, preside at the Eucharist and pronounce the<br/>Commendation.</i></p>
<p><i>It is desirable that the Lesson from the Old Testament, and the<br/>Epistle, be read by lay persons.</i></p>
<p><i>When the services of a priest cannot be obtained, a deacon or lay<br/>reader may preside at the service.</i></p>
<p><i>At the burial of a child, the passages from Lamentations, 1 John, and<br/><a href="bible:John+6">John 6</a>, together with <a href="bible:Psalm+23">Psalm 23</a>, are recommended.</i></p>
<p><i>It is customary that the celebrant meet the body and go before it into<br/>the church or towards the grave.</i></p>
<p><i>The anthems at the beginning of the service are sung or said as the<br/>body is borne into the church, or during the entrance of the ministers,<br/>or by the celebrant standing in the accustomed place.</i></p>
