<p>O God, you have so consecrated the covenant of marriage<br/>that in it is represented the spiritual unity between Christ<br/>and his Church: Send therefore your blessing upon these your<br/>servants, that they may so love, honor, and cherish each other<br/>in faithfulness and patience, in wisdom and true godliness,<br/>that their home may be a haven of blessing and peace;<br/>through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you<br/>and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>The husband and wife still kneeling, the Priest adds this blessing</i></p>
<p>God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit, bless,<br/>preserve, and keep you; the Lord mercifully with his favor<br/>look upon you, and fill you with all spiritual benediction and<br/>grace; that you may faithfully live together in this life, and<br/>in the age to come have life everlasting.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<h1>The Peace</h1>
<p><i>The Celebrant may say to the people</i></p>
<p>The peace of the Lord be always with you.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  And also with you.</p>
<p><i>The newly married couple then greet each other, after which greetings<br/>may be exchanged throughout the congregation.</i></p>
<p><i>When Communion is not to follow, the wedding party leaves the church. A<br/>hymn, psalm, or anthem may be sung, or instrumental music may be<br/>played.</i></p>
