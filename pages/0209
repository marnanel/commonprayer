<p>Almighty God, who hast created us in thine own image:<br/>Grant us grace fearlessly to contend against evil and to make<br/>no peace with oppression; and, that we may reverently use<br/>our freedom, help us to employ it in the maintenance of<br/>justice in our communities and among the nations, to the<br/>glory of thy holy Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who<br/>liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, one God,<br/>now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<h1>22. For Social Service</h1>
<p>O Lord our heavenly Father, whose blessed Son came not to<br/>be served but to serve:  Bless, we beseech thee, all<br/>who, following in his steps, give themselves to the service of<br/>others; that with wisdom, patience, and courage, they may<br/>minister in his name to the suffering, the friendless, and the<br/>needy; for the love of him who laid down his life for us, the same<br/>thy Son our Savior Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth<br/>with thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>
