<p><i>Celebrant and People</i></p>
<p>Holy, Holy, Holy Lord, God of power and might,<br/>heaven and earth are full of your glory.<br/>  Hosanna in the highest.<br/>Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.<br/>  Hosanna in the highest.</p>
<p><i>The Celebrant continues</i></p>
<p>And so, Father, we who have been redeemed by him, and<br/>made a new people by water and the Spirit, now bring before<br/>you these gifts. Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be the<br/>Body and Blood of Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p><i>At the following words concerning the bread, the Celebrant is to hold<br/>it, or lay a hand upon it, and at the words concerning the cup, to hold<br/>or place a hand upon the cup and any other vessel containing wine to be<br/>consecrated.</i></p>
<p>On the night he was betrayed he took bread, said the<br/>blessing, broke the bread, and gave it to his friends, and<br/>said, "Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you.  Do<br/>this for the remembrance of me."</p>
<p>After supper, he took the cup of wine, gave thanks, and<br/>said, "Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new<br/>Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the<br/>forgiveness of sins.  Whenever you drink it, do this for the<br/>remembrance of me."</p>
<p>Remembering now his work of redemption, and offering to you this<br/>sacrifice of thanksgiving,<br/><i>We celebrate his death and resurrection,<br/>as we await the day of his coming.</i></p>
