<p>It is not ourselves that we proclaim; we proclaim Christ<br/>Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants, for Jesus' sake.<br/>For the same God who said, "Out of darkness let light shine,"<br/>has caused his light to shine within us, to give the light of<br/>revelation&mdash;the revelation of the glory of God in the face of<br/>Jesus Christ.  <i><a href="bible:2+Corinthians+4%3A5-6">2 Corinthians 4:5-6</a></i></p>
<p>If I say, "Surely the darkness will cover me, and the light<br/>around me turn to night," darkness is not dark to you, O<br/>Lord; the night is as bright as the day; darkness and light to<br/>you are both alike.  <i><a href="bible:Psalm+139%3A10-11">Psalm 139:10-11</a></i></p>
<p><i>The Officiant then says the Prayer for Light, using any one of the<br/>following for some other suitable prayer, first saying</i></p>
<p>Let us pray.</p>
<p>Almighty God, we give you thanks for surrounding us, as<br/>daylight fades, with the brightness of the vesper light; and we<br/>implore you of your great mercy that, as you enfold us with<br/>the radiance of this light, so you would shine into our hearts<br/>the brightness of your Holy Spirit; through Jesus Christ our<br/>Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>Grant us, Lord, the lamp of charity which never fails, that it<br/>may burn in us and shed its light on those around us, and<br/>that by its brightness we may have a vision of that holy City,<br/>where dwells the true and never-failing Light, Jesus Christ<br/>our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>O Lord God Almighty, as you have taught us to call the<br/>evening, the morning, and the noonday one day; and have<br/>made the sun to know its going down:  Dispel the darkness of<br/>our hearts, that by your brightness we may know you to be<br/>the true God and eternal light, living and reigning for ever<br/>and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
