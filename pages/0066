<p>Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, *<br/> according to thy word;</p>
<p>For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, *<br/> which thou hast prepared before the face of all people,</p>
<p>To be a light to lighten the Gentiles, *<br/> and to be the glory of thy people Israel.</p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br/> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.</p>
<h1>The Apostle's Creed</h1>
<p><i>Officiant and People together, all standing</i></p>
<p>I believe in God, the Father almighty,<br/> maker of heaven and earth;</p>
<p>And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord;<br/> who was conceived by the Holy Ghost,<br/> born of the Virgin Mary,<br/> suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br/> was crucified, dead, and buried.<br/> He descended into hell.<br/> The third day he rose again from the dead.<br/> He ascended into heaven,<br/> and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father almighty.<br/> From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.</p>
<p>I believe in the Holy Ghost,<br/> the holy catholic Church,<br/> the communion of saints,<br/> the forgiveness of sins,<br/> the resurrection of the body,<br/> and the life everlasting.  Amen.</p>
