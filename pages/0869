<p>The Song of the Three Children,</p>
<p>The Story of Susanna,</p>
<p>Of Bel and the Dragon,</p>
<p>The Prayer of Manasses,</p>
<p>The First Book of Maccabees,</p>
<p>The Second Book of Maccabees.</p>
<p>All the Books of the New Testament, as they are commonly received, we<br/>do receive, and account them Canonical.</p>
<h1>VII.  Of the Old Testament.</h1>
<p>The Old Testament is not contrary to the New: for both in the Old and<br/>New Testament everlasting life is offered to Mankind by Christ, who is<br/>the only Mediator between God and Man, being both God and Man.<br/>Wherefore they are not to be heard, which feign that the old Fathers did<br/>look only for transitory promises.  Although the Law given from God by<br/>Moses, as touching Ceremonies and Rites, do not bind Christian men, nor<br/>the Civil precepts thereof ought of necessity to be received in any<br/>commonwealth; yet notwithstanding, no Christian man whatsoever is free<br/>from the obedience of the Commandments which are called Moral.</p>
<h1>VIII.  Of the Creeds.</h1>
<p>The Nicene Creed, and that which is commonly called the Apostles' Creed,<br/>ought thoroughly to be received and believed: for they may be proved by<br/>most certain warrants of Holy Scripture.</p>
<p>The original Article given Royal assent in 1571 and reaffirmed in 1662,<br/>was entitled, "Of the Three Creeds; and began as follows, "The Three<br/>Creeds, Nicene Creed, Athanasius's Creed, and that which is commonly<br/>called the Apostles' Creed..."</p>
<h1>IX.  Of Original or Birth Sin.</h1>
<p>Original sin standeth not in the following of Adam, (as the Pelagians do<br/>vainly talk;) but it is the fault and corruption of the Nature of every<br/>man, that naturally is engendered of the offspring of Adam; whereby man<br/>is very far gone from original righteousness, and is of his own nature<br/>inclined to evil, so that the flesh lusteth always contrary to the<br/>Spirit; and therefore in every person born into this world, it deserveth<br/>God's wrath and damnation.  And this infection of nature doth remain,<br/>yea in them that are regenerated; whereby the lust of the flesh, called<br/>in Greek, <i>fro/nhma sarko/s</i>, (which some do expound the wisdom, some<br/>sensuality, some the affection, some the desire, of the flesh), is not<br/>subject to the Law of God.  And although there is no condemnation for<br/>them that believe and are baptized; yet the Apostle doth confess, that<br/>concupiscence and lust hath of itself the nature of sin.</p>
<h1>X.  Of Free Will.</h1>
<p>The condition of Man after the fall of Adam is such, that he cannot turn<br/>and prepare himself, by his own natural strength and good works, to<br/>faith, and calling upon God.  Wherefore we have no power to do good<br/>works pleasant and acceptable to God, without the grace of God by Christ<br/>preventing us, that we may have a good will, and working with us, when<br/>we have that good will.</p>
