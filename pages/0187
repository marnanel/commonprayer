<h1>Confession of Saint Peter</h1>  <i>January 18</i>
<p>Almighty Father, who didst inspired Simon Peter, first among<br/>the apostles, to confess Jesus as Messiah and Son of the living<br/>God: Keep thy Church steadfast upon the rock of this faith,<br/>so that in unity and peace we may proclaim the one truth and<br/>follow the one Lord, our Savior Jesus Christ; who liveth and<br/>reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for<br/>ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<h1>Conversion of Saint Paul</h1>  <i>January 25</i>
<p>O God, who, by the preaching of thine apostle Paul, hast<br/>caused the light of the Gospel to shine throughout the world:<br/>Grant, we beseech thee, that we, having his wonderful<br/>conversion in remembrance, may show forth our thankfulness<br/>unto thee for the same by following the holy doctrine which<br/>he taught; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and<br/>reigneth with thee, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God,<br/>now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p>Almighty and everliving God, we humbly beseech thee that,<br/>as thy only-begotten Son was this day presented in the<br/>temple, so we may be presented to you with pure and<br/>clean hearts by the same Jesus Christ our Lord; who<br/>liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, one God,<br/>now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
