<p><i>A Collect for Sundays</i></p>
<p>Lord God, whose Son our Savior Jesus Christ triumphed<br/>over the powers of death and prepared for us our place in the<br/>new Jerusalem:  Grant that we, who have this day given<br/>thanks for his resurrection, may praise thee in that City of<br/>which he is the light; and where he liveth and reigneth for ever<br/>and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>A Collect for Fridays</i></p>
<p>O Lord Jesus Christ, who by thy death didst take away the<br/>sting of death:  Grant unto us thy servants so to follow in<br/>faith where thou hast led the way, that we may at length fall<br/>asleep peacefully in thee, and awake up after thy likeness; for<br/>thy tender mercies' sake.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>A Collect for Saturdays</i></p>
<p>O God, the source of eternal light:  Shed forth thine unending<br/>day upon us who watch for thee, that our lips may praise thee,<br/>our lives may bless thee, and our worship on the morrow may<br/>give thee glory; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>A Collect for Peace</i></p>
<p>O God, from whom all holy desires, all good counsels, and<br/>all just works do proceed:  Give unto thy servants that peace<br/>which the world cannot give, that our hearts may be set to<br/>obey thy commandments, and also that by thee, we, being<br/>defended from the fear of all enemies, may pass our time in<br/>rest and quietness; through the merits of Jesus Christ our<br/>Savior.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
