<p><i>Then, facing the Holy Table, the Celebrant proceeds</i></p>
<p>It is truly right to glorify you, Father, and to give you thanks;<br/>for you alone are God, living and true, dwelling in light<br/>inaccessible from before time and for ever.</p>
<p>Fountain of life and source of all goodness, you made all<br/>things and fill them with your blessing; you created them to<br/>rejoice in the splendour of your radiance.</p>
<p>Countless throngs of angels stand before you to serve you<br/>night and day; and, beholding the glory of your presence,<br/>they offer you unceasing praise.  Joining with them, and<br/>giving voice to every creature under heaven, we acclaim you,<br/>and glorify your Name, as we sing (say),</p>
<p><i>Celebrant and People</i></p>
<p>Holy, Holy, Holy Lord, God of power and might,<br/>heaven and earth are full of your glory.<br/>  Hosanna in the highest.<br/>Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.<br/>  Hosanna in the highest.</p>
<p><i>The people stand or kneel.</i></p>
<p><i>Then the Celebrant continues</i></p>
<p>We acclaim you, holy Lord, glorious in power.  Your mighty<br/>works reveal your wisdom and love.  You formed us in your<br/>own image, giving the whole world into our care, so that, in<br/>obedience to you, our Creator, we might rule and serve all<br/>your creatures.  When our disobedience took us far from you,<br/>you did not abandon us to the power of death.  In your mercy<br/>you came to our help, so that in seeking you we might find<br/>you.  Again and again you called us into covenant with you,<br/>and through the prophets you taught us to hope for salvation.</p>
