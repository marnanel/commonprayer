<h1>Part III.  Holy Communion</h1>
<p><i>If the Eucharist is to be celebrated, the Priest begins with the [Peace<br/>and] Offertory.</i></p>
<p>*If Communion is to be administered from the reserved Sacrament, the<br/>form for Communion under Special Circumstances is used, beginning with<br/>the [Peace and] Lord's Prayer on page <a href="398.html">398</a>.</p>
<p><i>If the sick person cannot receive either the consecrated Bread or the<br/>Wine, it is suitable to administer the Sacrament in one kind only.</i></p>
<p><i>One of the usual postcommunion prayers is said, or the following</i></p>
<p>Gracious Father, we give you praise and thanks for this Holy<br/>Communion of the Body and Blood of your beloved Son<br/>Jesus Christ, the pledge of our redemption; and we pray that<br/>it may bring us forgiveness of our sins, strength in our<br/>weakness, and everlasting salvation; through Jesus Christ<br/>our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>The service concludes with a blessing or with a dismissal</i></p>
<p>Let us bless the Lord.<br/><i>Thanks be to God.</i></p>
<p><i>If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme<br/>sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread<br/>and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits<br/>of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received<br/>with the mouth.</i></p>
