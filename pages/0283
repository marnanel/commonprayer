<h1>Holy Saturday</h1>
<p><i>There is no celebration of the Eucharist on this day.</i></p>
<p><i>When there is a Liturgy of the word, the Celebrant begins with the<br/>Collect of the Day</i></p>
<p>O God, Creator of heaven and earth: Grant that, as the<br/>crucified body of your dear Son was laid in the tomb and<br/>rested on this holy Sabbath, so we may await with him the<br/>coming of the third day, and rise with him to newness of<br/>life; who now lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,<br/>one God, for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
