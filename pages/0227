<h1>The Day of Pentecost:  Whitsunday</h1>
<p><i>When a Vigil of Pentecost is observed, it begins with the Service of<br/>Light, page <a href="109.html">109</a> (substituting, if desired, the Gloria in Excelsis for<br/>the Phos hilaron), and continues with the Salutation and Collect of the<br/>Day.  Three or more of the appointed Lessons are read before the Gospel,<br/>each followed by a Psalm, Canticle, or hymn.  Holy Baptism or<br/>Confirmation (beginning with the Presentation of the Candidates), or the<br/>Renewal of Baptismal Vows, page <a href="292.html">292</a>, follows the Sermon.</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, on this day you opened the way of eternal life<br/>to every race and nation by the promised gift of your Holy<br/>Spirit:  Shed abroad this gift throughout the world by the<br/>preaching of the Gospel, that it may reach to the ends of the<br/>earth; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns<br/>with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever<br/>and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>O God, who on this day taught the hearts of your faithful<br/>people by sending to them the light of your Holy Spirit:<br/>Grant us by the same Spirit to have a right judgment in all<br/>things, and evermore to rejoice in his holy comfort; through<br/>Jesus Christ your Son our Lord, who lives and reigns with<br/>you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and<br/>ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
