<h1>Concerning the Catechism</h1>
<p><i>This catechism is primarily intended for use by parish priests,<br/>deacons, and lay catechists, to give an outline for instruction.  It is<br/>a commentary on the creeds, but is not meant to be a complete statement<br/>of belief and practices; rather, it is a point of departure for the<br/>teacher, and it is cast in the traditional question and answer form for<br/>ease of reference.</i></p>
<p><i>The second use of this catechism is to provide a brief summary of the<br/>Church's teaching for an inquiring stranger who picks up a Prayer Book.</i></p>
<p><i>It may also be used to form a simple service; since the matter is<br/>arranged under headings, it is suitable for selective use, and the<br/>leader may introduce prayers and hymns as needed.</i></p>
