<h1>An Outline of the Faith<br/>commonly called the Catechism</h1>
<h1>Human Nature</h1>
<p><b><span class="person">Q</span></b> What are we by nature?</p>
<p><b><span class="person">A</span></b> We are part of God's creation, made in the image of God.</p>
<p><b><span class="person">Q</span></b> What does it mean to be created in the image of God?</p>
<p><b><span class="person">A</span></b> It means that we are free to make choices: to love, to create, to<br/>reason, and to live in harmony with creation and with God.</p>
<p><b><span class="person">Q</span></b> Why then do we live apart from God and out of harmony with<br/>creation?</p>
<p><b><span class="person">A</span></b> From the beginning, human beings have misused their freedom and<br/>made wrong choices.</p>
<p><b><span class="person">Q</span></b> Why do we not use our freedom as we should?</p>
<p><b><span class="person">A</span></b> Because we rebel against God, and we put ourselves in the place of<br/>God.</p>
<p><b><span class="person">Q</span></b> What help is there for us?</p>
<p><b><span class="person">A</span></b> Our help is in God.</p>
<p><b><span class="person">Q</span></b> How did God first help us?</p>
<p><b><span class="person">A</span></b> God first helped us by revealing himself and his will, through<br/>nature and history, through many seers and saints, and especially the<br/>prophets of Israel.</p>
