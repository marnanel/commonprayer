<p>The third day he rose again from the dead.<br/> He ascended into heaven,<br/> and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father almighty.<br/> From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.</p>
<p>I believe in the Holy Ghost,<br/> the holy catholic Church,<br/> the communion of saints,<br/> the forgiveness of sins,<br/> the resurrection of the body,<br/> and the life everlasting.  Amen.</p>
