<p>In any of the Proper Liturgies for Special Days, and in other services<br/>contained within this Book celebrated in the context of a Rite One<br/>service, the contemporary idiom may be conformed to traditional<br/>language.</p>
<p>Hymns referred to in the rubrics of this Book are understood as those<br/>authorized by this Church.  The words of anthems are to be from<br/>Holy Scripture, or from this Book, or from texts congruent with them.</p>
<p>On occasion, and as appropriate, instrumental music may be substituted<br/>for a hymn or anthem.</p>
<p>Where rubrics indicate that a part of a service is to be "said," it must<br/>be understood to include "or sung," and <i>vice versa.</i></p>
<p>When it is desired to use music composed for them, previously authorized<br/>liturgical texts may be used in place of the corresponding texts in this<br/>Book.</p>
<p>Scriptural citations in this Book, except for the Psalms, follow the<br/>numeration of the Revised Standard Version of the Bible.</p>
