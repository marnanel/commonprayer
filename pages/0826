<p><i>35.  For the Poor and the Neglected</i></p>
<p>Almighty and most merciful God, we remember before you<br/>all poor and neglected persons whom it would be easy for us<br/>to forget:  the homeless and the destitute, the old and the sick,<br/>and all who have none to care for them.  Help us to heal those<br/>who are broken in body or spirit, and to turn their sorrow<br/>into joy.  Grant this, Father, for the love of your Son, who for<br/>our sake became poor, Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>36.  For the Oppresed</i></p>
<p>Look with pity, O heavenly Father, upon the people in this<br/>land who live with injustice, terror, disease, and death as<br/>their constant companions.  Have mercy upon us.  Help us to<br/>eliminate our cruelty to these our neighbors.  Strengthen those<br/>who spend their lives establishing equal protection of the law<br/>and equal opportunities for all.  And grant that every one of<br/>us may enjoy a fair portion of the riches of this land; through<br/>Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>37.  For Prisons and Correctional Institutions</i></p>
<p>Lord Jesus, for our sake you were condemned as a criminal:<br/>Visit our jails and prisons with your pity and judgment.<br/>Remember all prisoners, and bring the guilty to repentance<br/>and amendment of life according to your will, and give them<br/>hope for their future.  When any are held unjustly, bring them<br/>release; forgive us, and teach us to improve our justice.<br/>Remember those who work in these institutions; keep them<br/>humane and compassionate; and save them from becoming<br/>brutal or callous.  And since what we do for those in prison,<br/>O Lord, we do for you, constrain us to improve their lot.  All<br/>this we ask for your mercy's sake.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
