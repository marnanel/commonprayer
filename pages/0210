<h1>24. For Vocation in Daily Work</h1>
<p>Almighty God our heavenly Father, who declarest thy glory<br/>and showest forth thy handiwork in the heavens and in the<br/>earth:  Deliver us, we beseech thee, in our various occupations<br/>from the service of self alone, that we may do the work<br/>which thou givest us to do in truth and beauty and for the<br/>common good; for the sake of him who came among us as<br/>one that serveth, thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth<br/>and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever<br/>and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<h1>25. For Labor Day</h1>
<p>Almighty God, who hast so linked our lives one with another<br/>that all we do affects, for good or ill, all other lives:  So guide<br/>us in the work we do, that we may do it not for self alone, but<br/>for the common good; and, as we seek a proper return for<br/>our own labor, make us mindful of the rightful aspirations of<br/>other workers, and arouse our concern for those who are out<br/>of work; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and<br/>reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and<br/>ever. <i>Amen.</i></p>
