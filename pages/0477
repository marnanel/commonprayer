<p>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,<br/>I will fear no evil; *<br/> for thou are with me;<br/> thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.</p>
<p>Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of<br/>  mine enemies; *<br/> thou annointest my head with oil;<br/> my cup runneth over.</p>
<p>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days<br/>  of my life, *<br/> and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.</p>
<h1><a href="bible:Psalm+27">Psalm 27</a></h1>  <i>Dominus illuminatio</i>
<p>The LORD is my light and my salvation;<br/>whom then shall I fear? *<br/> the LORD is the strength of my life;<br/> of whom then shall I be afraid?</p>
<p>One thing have I desired of the LORD, which I will require, *<br/> even that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the<br/>  days of my life,<br/> to behold the fair beauty of the LORD, and to visit his temple.</p>
<p>For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his tabernacle; *<br/> yea, in the secret place of his dwelling shall he hide me,<br/> and set me up upon a rock of stone.</p>
<p>And now shall he lift up mine head *<br/> above mine enemies round about me.</p>
<p>Therefore will I offer in his dwelling an oblation with<br/>  great gladness; *<br/> I will sing and speak praises unto the LORD.</p>
<p>Hearken unto my voice, O LORD, when I cry unto thee; *<br/> have mercy upon me, and hear me.</p>
