<p>Father in heaven, who at the baptism of Jesus in the River<br/>Jordan didst proclaim him thy beloved Son and anoint him<br/>with the Holy Spirit:  Grant that all who are baptized into his<br/>Name may keep the covenant they have made, and boldly<br/>confess him as Lord and Savior; who with thee and the same<br/>Holy Spirit liveth and reigneth, one God, in glory everlasting.<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>

<p>Almighty God, whose Son our Savior Jesus Christ is the light<br/>of the world:  Grant that thy people, illumined by thy Word<br/>and Sacraments, may shine with the radiance of Christ's<br/>glory, that he may be known, worshiped, and obeyed to the ends of the<br/>earth; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who with thee and the Holy Spirit<br/>liveth and reigneth, one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
