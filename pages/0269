<p>By the cross and passion of your Son our Lord,<br/><i>Bring us with all your saints to the joy of his resurrection.</i></p>
<p><i>The Bishop, if present, or the Priest, stands and, facing the people,<br/>says</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who<br/>desires not the death of sinners, but rather that they may turn<br/>from their wickedness and live, has given power and<br/>commandment to his ministers to declare and pronounce to<br/>his people, being penitent, the absolution and remission of<br/>their sins.  He pardons and absolves all those who truly<br/>repent, and with sincere hearts believe his holy Gospel.</p>
<p>Therefore we beseech him to grant us true repentance and his<br/>Holy Spirit, that those things may please him which we do on<br/>this day, and that the rest of our life hereafter may be pure<br/>and holy, so that at the last we may come to his eternal joy;<br/>through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>A deacon or lay reader leading the service remains kneeling and<br/>substitutes the prayer for forgiveness appointed at Morning Prayer.</i></p>
<p><i>The Peace is then exchanged.</i></p>
<p><i>In the absence of a bishop or priest, all that precedes may be led by a<br/>deacon or lay reader.</i></p>
<p><i>The Litany of Penitence may be used at other times, and may be preceded<br/>by an appropriate invitation and a penitential psalm.</i></p>
<p><i>When Communion follows, the service continues with the Offertory.</i></p>
