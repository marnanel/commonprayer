<p><i>At the following words concerning the bread, the Celebrant is to hold<br/>it, or lay a hand upon it; and at the words concerning the cup, to hold<br/>or place a hand upon the cup and any other vessel containing wine to be<br/>consecrated</i></p>
<p>For in the night in which he was betrayed, he took bread;<br/>and when he had given thanks to thee, he broke it, and gave it<br/>to his disciples, saying, "Take, eat, this is my Body, which is<br/>given for you.  Do this in remembrance of me."</p>
<p>Likewise, after supper, he took the cup; and when he had<br/>given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, "Drink this, all of<br/>you; for this is my Blood of the New Covenant, which is shed<br/>for you, and for many, for the remission of sins.  Do this, as<br/>oft as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me."</p>
<p>Wherefore, O Lord and heavenly Father, we thy people do<br/>celebrate and make, with these thy holy gifts which we now<br/>offer unto thee, the memorial thy Son hath commanded us to<br/>make; having in remembrance his blessed passion and precious<br/>death, his mighty resurrection and glorious ascension; and<br/>looking for his coming again with power and great glory.</p>
<p>And we most humbly beseech thee, O merciful Father, to<br/>hear us, and, with thy Word and Holy Spirit, to bless and<br/>sanctify these gifts of bread and wine, that they may be unto<br/>us the Body and Blood of thy dearly-beloved Son Jesus<br/>Christ.</p>
<p>And we earnestly desire thy fatherly goodness to accept this<br/>our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving, whereby we offer<br/>and present unto thee, O Lord, our selves, our souls and<br/>bodies.  Grant, we beseech thee, that all who partake of this<br/>Holy Communion may worthily receive the most precious<br/>Body and Blood of thy Son Jesus Christ, and be filled with<br/>thy grace and heavenly benediction; and also that we and all<br/>thy whole Church may be made one body with him, that he</p>
