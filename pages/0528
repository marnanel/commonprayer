<p>Let us pray.</p>
<p>O God of unchangeable power and eternal light: Look<br/>favorably on your whole Church, that wonderful and sacred<br/>mystery; by the effectual working of your providence, carry<br/>out in tranquillity the plan of salvation; let the whole world<br/>see and know that things which were being cast down are being<br/>raised up, and things which had grown old are being made<br/>new, and that all things are being brought to their perfection<br/>by him through whom all things were made, your Son Jesus<br/>Christ our Lord; who lives and reigns with you, in the unity<br/>of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
