<p><i>The Celebrant continues</i></p>
<p>And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you,<br/>O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this<br/>bread and this wine.</p>
<p>We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon<br/>these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of<br/>Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant.  Unite us to your<br/>Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him,<br/>being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.  In the fullness of time,<br/>put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to<br/>that heavenly country where, with [__________ and] all your<br/>saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and<br/>daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all<br/>creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our<br/>salvation.</p>
<p>By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy<br/>Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and<br/>for ever.  <i>AMEN.</i></p>
