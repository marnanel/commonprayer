<p><i><a href="bible:Luke+2%3A29-32">Luke 2:29-32</a></i></p>
<p>Lord, you now have set your servant free *<br/> to go in peace as you have promised;</p>
<p>For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *<br/> whom you have prepared for all the world to see:</p>
<p>A Light to enlighten the nations, *<br/> and the glory of your people Israel.</p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br/> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.</p>

<p>I believe in God, the Father almighty,<br/> creator of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>I believe in Jesus Christ, his only son, our Lord.<br/> He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit<br/>  and born of the Virgin Mary.<br/> He suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br/>  was crucified, died, and was buried.<br/> He descended to the dead.<br/> On the third day he rose again.<br/> He ascended into heaven,<br/>  and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br/> He will come again to judge the living and the dead.</p>
<p>I believe in the Holy Spirit,<br/> the holy catholic Church,<br/> the communion of saints,<br/> the forgiveness of sins,<br/> the resurrection of the body,<br/> and the life everlasting.  Amen.</p>
