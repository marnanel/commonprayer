<p>If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus<br/>Christ the righteous; and he is the perfect offering for our<br/>sins, and not for ours only, but for the sins of the whole world.<br/><i><a href="bible:1+John+2%3A1-2">1 John 2:1-2</a></i></p>
<p><i>The Priest then continues</i></p>
<p>Now, in the presence of Christ, and of me, his minister,<br/>confess your sins with a humble and obedient heart to<br/>Almighty God, our Creator and our Redeemer.</p>
<p><i>The Penitent says</i></p>
<p>Holy God, heavenly Father, you formed me from the dust in<br/>your image and likeness, and redeemed me from sin and<br/>death by the cross of your Son Jesus Christ.  Through the<br/>water of baptism you clothed me with the shining garment of<br/>his righteousness, and established me among your children in<br/>your kingdom.  But I have squandered the inheritance of your<br/>saints, and have wandered far in a land that is waste.</p>
<p>Especially, I confess to you and to the Church...</p>
<p><i>Here the Penitent confesses particular sins.</i></p>
<p>Therefore, O Lord, from these and all other sins I cannot<br/>now remember, I turn to you in sorrow and repentance.<br/>Receive me again into the arms of your mercy, and restore me<br/>to the blessed company of your faithful people; through him<br/>in whom you have redeemed the world, your Son our Savior<br/>Jesus Christ.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>The Priest may then offer words of comfort and counsel.</i></p>
<p><i>Priest</i></p>
<p>Will you turn again to Christ as your Lord?</p>
<p><i>Penitent</i>  I will.</p>
