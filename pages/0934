<p><i>Concerning the Daily Office Lectionary</i></p>
<p><i>The Daily Office Lectionary is arranged in a two-year cycle. Year One<br/>begins on the First Sunday of Advent preceding odd-numbered years, and<br/>Year Two begins on the First Sunday of Advent preceding even-numbered<br/>years.  (Thus, on the First Sunday of Advent, 1976, the Lectionary for<br/>Year One is begun.)</i></p>
<p><i>Three Readings are provided for each Sunday and weekday in each of the<br/>two years.  Two of the Readings may be used in the morning and one in<br/>the evening; or, if the Office is read only once in the day, all three<br/>Readings may be used.  When the Office is read twice in the day, it is<br/>suggested that the Gospel Reading be used in the evening in Year One,<br/>and in the morning in Year Two.  If two Readings are desired at both<br/>Offices, the Old Testament Reading for the alternate year is used as the<br/>First Reading at Evening Prayer.</i></p>
<p><i>When more than one Reading is used at an Office, the first is always<br/>from the Old Testament (or the Apocrypha).</i></p>
<p><i>When a Major Feast interrupts the sequence of Readings, they may be re-<br/>ordered by lengthening, combining, or omitting some of them, to secure<br/>continuity or avoid repitition.</i></p>
<p><i>Any Reading may be lengthened at discretion.  Suggested lengthenings<br/>are shown in parentheses.</i></p>
<p><i>In this Lectionary (except in the weeks from 4 Advent to 1 Epiphany,<br/>and Palm Sunday to 2 Easter), the Psalms are arranged in a seven-week<br/>pattern which recurs throughout the year, except for appropriate<br/>variations in Lent and Easter Season.</i></p>
<p><i>In the citation of the Psalms, those for the morning are given first,<br/>and then those for the evening.  At the discretion of the officiant,<br/>however, any of the Psalms appointed for a given day may be used in the<br/>morning or in the evening.  Likewise, Psalms appointed for any day may<br/>be used on any other day in the same week, except on major Holy Days.</i></p>
