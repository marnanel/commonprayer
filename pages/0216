<p>O God, the strength of all who put their trust in you:<br/>Mercifully accept our prayers; and because in our weakness<br/>we can do nothing good without you, give us the help of your<br/>grace, that in keeping your commandments we may please<br/>you both in will and deed; through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br/>who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God,<br/>for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<h1>Seventh Sunday after the Epiphany</h1>
<p>O Lord, you have taught us that without love whatever we<br/>do is worth nothing; Send your Holy Spirit and pour into our<br/>hearts your greatest gift, which is love, the true bond of peace<br/>and of all virtue, without which whoever lives is accounted<br/>dead before you.  Grant this for the sake of your only Son<br/>Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy<br/>Spirit, one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
