<p>O gracious light,<br/>pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven,<br/>O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!</p>
<p>Now as we come to the setting of the sun,<br/>and our eyes behold the vesper light,<br/>we sing your praises, O God:  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>You are worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices,<br/>O Son of God, O Giver of Life,<br/>and to be glorified through all the worlds.</p>
<p><i>A Reading</i></p>
<p>It is not ourselves that we proclaim; we proclaim Christ<br/>Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants, for Jesus' sake.<br/>For the same God who said, "Out of darkness let light<br/>shine," has caused his light to shine within us, to give the<br/>light of revelation&mdash;the revelation of the glory of God in the<br/>face of Jesus Christ.  <i><a href="bible:2+Corinthians+4%3A5-6">2 Corinthians 4:5-6</a></i></p>
<p><i>Prayers may be offered for ourselves and others.</i></p>
<p><i>The Lord's Prayer</i></p>
<p><i>The Collect</i></p>
<p>Lord Jesus, stay with us, for evening is at hand and the day is<br/>past; be our companion in the way, kindle our hearts, and<br/>awaken hope, that we may know you as you are revealed in<br/>Scripture and the breaking of bread.  Grant this for the sake<br/>of your love.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
