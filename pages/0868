<h1>II.  Of the Word or Son of God, which was made very Man.</h1>
<p>The Son, which is the Word of the Father, begotten from everlasting of<br/>the Father, the very and eternal God, and of one substance with the<br/>Father, took Man's nature in the womb of the blessed Virgin, of her<br/>substance: so that two whole and perfect Natures, that is to say, the<br/>Godhead and Manhood, were joined together in one Person, never to be<br/>divided, whereof is one Christ, very God, and very Man; who truly<br/>suffered, was crucified, dead, and buried, to reconcile his Father to<br/>us, and to be a sacrifice, not only for original guilt, but also for<br/>actual sins of men.</p>
<h1>III.  Of the going down of Christ into Hell.</h1>
<p>As Christ died for us, and was buried; so also it is to be believed,<br/>that he went down into Hell.</p>
<h1>IV.  Of the Resurrection of Christ.</h1>
<p>Christ did truly rise again from death, and took again his body, with<br/>flesh, bones, and all things appertaining to the perfection of Man's<br/>nature; wherewith he ascended into Heaven, and there sitteth, until he<br/>return to judge all Men at the last day.</p>
<h1>V.  Of the Holy Ghost.</h1>
<p>The Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the Son, is of one<br/>substance, majesty, and glory, with the Father and the Son, very and<br/>eternal God.</p>
<h1>VI.  Of the Sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures for Salvation.</h1>
<p>Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that<br/>whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be<br/>required of any man, that it should be believed as an article of the<br/>Faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation.  In the name<br/>of the Holy Scripture we do understand those canonical Books of the Old<br/>and New Testament, of whose authority was never any doubt in the Church.</p>
