<h1>The Calendar<br/>of the Church Year</h1>
<p>The Church Year consists of two cycles of feasts and holy days:  one is<br/>dependent upon the movable date of the Sunday of the Resurrection or<br/>Easter Day; the other, upon the fixed date of December 25, the Feast of<br/>our Lord's Nativity or Christmas Day.</p>
<p>Easter Day is always the first Sunday after the full moon that falls on<br/>or after March 21.  It cannot occur before March 22 or after April 25.</p>
<p>The sequence of all Sundays of the Church Year depends upon the date of<br/>Easter Day.  But the Sundays of Advent are always the four Sundays<br/>before Christmas Day, whether it occurs on a Sunday or a weekday.  The<br/>date of Easter also determines the beginning of Lent on Ash Wednesday,<br/>and the feast of the Ascension on a Thursday forty days after Easter<br/>Day.</p>
<h1>1.  Principal Feasts</h1>
<p>The Principal Feasts observed in this Church are the following:</p>
<p>Easter Day</p>
<p>Ascension Day</p>
<p>The Day of Pentecost</p>
<p>Trinity Sunday</p>
<p>All Saint's Day : November 1</p>
<p>Christmas Day : December 25</p>
<p>The Epiphany : January 6</p>
<p>These feasts take precedence of any other day or observance.  All<br/>Saints' Day may always be observed on the Sunday following November 1,<br/>in addition to its observance on the fixed date.</p>
