<p><i>The Bishop when present, or the Priest, stands and says</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, our heavenly Father, who of his great mercy<br/>hath promised forgiveness of sins to all those who with<br/>hearty repentance and true faith turn unto him, have mercy<br/>upon you, pardon and deliver you from all your sins, confirm<br/>and strengthen you in all goodness, and bring you to<br/>everlasting life; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>A Minister may then say one or more of the following sentences, first<br/>saying</i></p>
<p>Hear the Word of God to all who truly turn to him.</p>
<p>Come unto me, all ye that travail and are heavy laden, and I will<br/>refresh you.  <i><a href="bible:Matthew+11%3A28">Matthew 11:28</a></i></p>
<p>God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son,<br/>to the end that all that believe in him should not perish, but<br/>have everlasting life.  <i><a href="bible:John+3%3A16">John 3:16</a></i></p>
<p>This is a true saying, and worthy of all men to be received,<br/>that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.<br/><i><a href="bible:I+Timothy+1%3A15">I Timothy 1:15</a></i></p>
<p>If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus<br/>Christ the righteous; and he is the perfect offering for our<br/>sins, and not for ours only, but for the sins of the whole<br/>world.  <i><a href="bible:I+John+2%3A1-2">I John 2:1-2</a></i></p>
<h1>The Peace</h1>
<p><i>All stand.  The Celebrant says to the people</i></p>
<p>The peace of the Lord be always with you.</p>
<p><i>People</i>  And with thy spirit.</p>
<p><i>Then the Ministers and People may greet one another in the name of the<br/>Lord.</i></p>
