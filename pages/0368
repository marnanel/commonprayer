<p><i>The people stand or kneel.</i></p>
<p><i>Then the Celebrant continues</i></p>
<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love<br/>which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling<br/>of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the<br/>prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your<br/>Son.  For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from<br/>the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world.<br/>In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy<br/>to stand before you.  In him, you have brought us out of error<br/>into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p><i>At the following words concerning the bread, the Celebrant is to hold<br/>it, or to lay a hand upon it; and at the words concerning the cup, to<br/>hold or place a hand upon the cup and any other vessel containing wine<br/>to be consecrated.</i></p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took<br/>bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and<br/>gave it to his disciples, and said, "Take, eat: This is my Body,<br/>which is given for you.  Do this for the remembrance of me."</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given<br/>thanks, he gave it to them, and said, "Drink this, all of you:<br/>This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you<br/>and for many for the forgiveness of sins.  Whenever you drink<br/>it, do this for the remembrance of me."</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>
<p><i>Celebrant and People</i></p>
<p>We remember his death,<br/>We proclaim his resurrection,<br/>We await his coming in glory;</p>
