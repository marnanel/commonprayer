<p><i>62.  A Prayer attributed to St. Francis</i></p>
<p>Lord, make us instruments of your peace.  Where there is<br/>hatred, let us sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where<br/>there is discord, union; where there is doubt, faith; where<br/>there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; where<br/>there is sadness, joy.  Grant that we may not so much seek to<br/>be consoled as to console; to be understood as to understand;<br/>to be loved as to love.  For it is in giving that we receive; it is<br/>in pardoning that we are pardoned; and it is in dying that we<br/>are born to eternal life.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p><i>63.  In the Evening</i></p>
<p>O Lord, support us all the day long, until the shadows<br/>lengthen, and the evening comes, and the busy world is<br/>hushed, and the fever of life is over, and our work is done.<br/>Then in <i>thy</i> mercy, grant us a safe lodging, and a holy rest,<br/>and peace at the last.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>64.  Before Worship</i></p>
<p>O Almighty God, <i>who pourest</i> out on all who desire it the<br/>spirit of grace and of supplication:  Deliver us, when we draw<br/>near to <i>thee</i>, from coldness of heart and wanderings of mind,<br/>that with steadfast thoughts and kindled affections we may<br/>worship <i>thee</i> in spirit and in truth; through Jesus Christ our<br/>Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
