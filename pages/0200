<p>Almighty and most merciful God, grant, we beseech thee,<br/>that by the indwelling of thy Holy Spirit we may be enlightened<br/>and strengthened for thy service; through Jesus Christ our<br/>Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee, in the unity of the<br/>Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<h1>3. Of the Holy Angels</h1>
<p>O Everlasting God, who hast ordained and constituted the<br/>ministries of angels and men in a wonderful order: Mercifully<br/>grant that, as thy holy angels always serve and worship thee in<br/>heaven, so by thy appointment they may help and defend us<br/>on earth; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and<br/>reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever<br/>and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<h1>4. Of the Incarnation</h1>
<p>O God, who didst wonderfully create, and yet more<br/>wonderfully restore, the dignity of human nature:  Grant<br/>that we may share the divine life of him who humbled<br/>himself to share our humanity, thy Son Jesus Christ; who<br/>liveth and reigneth with thee, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br/>one God, for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
