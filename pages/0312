<h1>Additional Directions</h1>
<p><i>Holy Baptism is especially appropriate at the Easter Vigil, on the<br/>Day of Pentecost, on All Saints' Day or the Sunday after All Saints'<br/>Day, and on the Feast of the Baptism of our Lord (the First Sunday<br/>after the Epiphany).  It is recommended that, as far as possible,<br/>Baptisms be reserved for these occasions or when a bishop is<br/>present.</i></p>
<p><i>If on any one of the above-named days the ministry of a bishop or<br/>priest cannot be obtained, the bishop may specially authorize a<br/>deacon to preside.  In that case, the deacon omits the prayer over<br/>the candidates, page <a href="308.html">308</a>, and the formula and action which follow.</i></p>
<p><i>These omitted portions of the rite may be administered on some<br/>subsequent occasion of public baptism at which a bishop or priest<br/>presides.</i></p>
<p><i>If on the four days listed above there are no candidates for Baptism,<br/>the Renewal of Baptismal vows, page <a href="292.html">292</a>, may take the place of the<br/>Nicene Creed at the Eucharist.</i></p>
<p><i>If desired, the hymn Gloria in excelsis may be sung immediately after<br/>the opening versicles and before the salutation "The Lord be with you."</i></p>
<p><i>When a bishop is present, or on other occasions for sufficient reason,<br/>the Collect (page <a href="203.html">203</a> or 254) and one or more of the Lessons provided<br/>for use at Baptism (page <a href="928.html">928</a>) may be substituted for the Proper of the<br/>Day.</i></p>
<p><i>Lay persons may act as readers, and it is appropriate for sponsors to<br/>be assigned this function.  The petitions (page <a href="303.html">303</a>) map also be led by<br/>one of the sponsors.</i></p>
<p><i>The Nicene Creed is not used at this service.</i></p>
<p><i>If the Presentation of the Candidates does not take place at the font,<br/>then before or during the petitions (page <a href="305.html">305</a>), the ministers,<br/>candidates, and sponsors go to the font for the Thanksgiving over the<br/>Water.</i></p>
<p><i>If the movement to the font is a formal procession, a suitable psalm,<br/>such as <a href="bible:Psalm+42">Psalm 42</a>, or a hymn or anthem, may be sung.</i></p>
