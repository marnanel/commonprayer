<p><i>32.  For the Good Use of Leisure</i></p>
<p>O God, in the course of this busy life, give us times of<br/>refreshment and peace; and grant that we may so use our<br/>leisure to rebuild our bodies and renew our minds, that our<br/>spirits may be opened to the goodness of your creation;<br/>through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>33.  For Cities</i></p>
<p>Heavenly Father, in your Word you have given us a vision of<br/>that holy City to which the nations of the world bring their<br/>glory:  Behold and visit, we pray, the cities of the earth.<br/>Renew the ties of mutual regard which form our civic life.<br/>Send us honest and able leaders.  Enable us to eliminate<br/>poverty, prejudice, and oppression, that peace may prevail<br/>with righteousness, and justice with order, and that men and<br/>women from different cultures and with differing talents may<br/>find with one another the fulfillment of their humanity;<br/>through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>34.  For Towns and Rural Areas</i></p>
<p>Lord Christ, when you came among us, you proclaimed the<br/>kingdom of God in villages, towns, and lonely places:  Grant<br/>that your presence and power may be known throughout this<br/>land.  Have mercy upon all of us who live and work in rural<br/>areas [especially __________]; and grant that all the people<br/>of our nation may give thanks to you for food and drink and<br/>all other bodily necessities of life, respect those who labor to<br/>produce them, and honor the land and the water from which<br/>these good things come.  All this we ask in your holy Name.<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>
