<p>Almighty Father, we thank you for feeding us with the holy<br/>food of the Body and Blood of your Son, and for uniting us<br/>through him in the fellowship of your Holy Spirit.  We thank<br/>you for raising up among us faithful servants for the ministry<br/>of your Word and Sacraments.  We pray that <b><span class="person">N</span></b> may be to us<br/>an effective example in word and action, in love and patience,<br/>and in holiness of life.  Grant that we, with <i>him</i>, may serve<br/>you now, and always rejoice in your glory; through Jesus<br/>Christ your Son our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and<br/>the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>The new Bishop blesses the people, first saying</i></p>

<p><i>A Deacon dismisses the people</i></p>
<p>Let us go forth into the world, rejoicing in the<br/>power of the Spirit.</p>
<p><i>People</i>      Thanks be to God.</p>
<p><i>From Easter Day through the Day of Pentecost, "Alleluia, alleluia," may<br/>be added to the dismissal and to the response.</i></p>
