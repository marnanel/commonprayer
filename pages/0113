<p>Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of our fathers, creator<br/>of the changes of day and night, giving rest to the weary,<br/>renewing the strength of those who are spent, bestowing<br/>upon us occasions of song in the evening.  As you have<br/>protected us in the day that is past, so be with us in the<br/>coming night; keep us from every sin, every evil, and every<br/>fear; for you are our light and salvation, and the strength of<br/>our life.  To you be glory for endless ages.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>Almighty, everlasting God, let our prayer in your sight be as<br/>incense, the lifting up of our hands as the evening sacrifice.<br/>Give us grace to behold you, present in your Word and<br/>Sacraments, and to recognize you in the lives of those around<br/>us.  Stir up in us the flame of that love which burned in the<br/>heart of your Son as he bore his passion, and let it burn in us<br/>to eternal life and to the ages of ages.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
