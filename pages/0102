<p><i>A Prayer of St. Chrysostom</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, you have given us grace at this time with one<br/>accord to make our common supplication to you; and you<br/>have promised through your well-beloved Son that when two<br/>or three are gathered together in his Name you will be in the<br/>midst of them:  Fulfill now, O Lord, our desires and petitions<br/>as may be best for us; granting us in this world knowledge of<br/>your truth, and in the age to come life everlasting.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>Then may be said</i></p>
<p>Let us bless the Lord.<br/><i>Thanks be to God.</i></p>
<p><i>From Easter Day through the Day of Pentecost "Alleluia, alleluia" may<br/>be added to the preceding versicle and response.</i></p>
<p><i>The Officiant may then conclude with one of the following</i></p>
<p>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and<br/>the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with us all evermore.<br/><i>Amen.</i>  <i><a href="bible:2+Corinthians+13%3A14">2 Corinthians 13:14</a></i></p>
<p>May the God of hope fill us with all joy and peace in<br/>believing through the power of the Holy Spirit.  <i>Amen.</i><br/><i><a href="bible:Romans+15%3A13">Romans 15:13</a></i></p>
<p>Glory to God whose power, working in us, can do infinitely<br/>more than we can ask or imagine:  Glory to him from<br/>generation to generation in the Church, and in Christ Jesus<br/>for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i>  <i><a href="bible:Ephesians+3%3A20%2C21">Ephesians 3:20,21</a></i></p>
