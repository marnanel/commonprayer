<h1>Concerning the Service</h1>
<p><i>In the course of their Christian development, those baptized at an<br/>early age are expected, when they are ready and have been duly prepared,<br/>to make a mature public affirmation of their faith and commitment to the<br/>responsibilities of their Baptism and to receive the laying on of hands<br/>by the bishop.</i></p>
<p><i>Those baptized as adults, unless baptized with laying on of hands by a<br/>bishop, are also expected to make a public affirmation of their faith<br/>and commitment to the responsibilities of their Baptism in the presence<br/>of a bishop and to receive the laying on of hands.</i></p>
<p><i>When there is no Baptism, the rites of Confirmation, Reception, and the<br/>Reaffirmation of Baptismal Vows are administered in the following form.</i></p>
<p><i>If desired, the hymn Gloria in excelsis may be sung immediately after<br/>the opening versicles and before the salutation, The Lord be with you."</i></p>
<p><i>The Nicene Creed is not used at this service.</i></p>
<p><i>It is appropriate that the oblations of bread and wine be presented by<br/>persons newly confirmed.</i></p>
