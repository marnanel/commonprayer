<p><i>Concerning the Ordination of a Bishop</i></p>
<p><i>In accordance with ancient custom, it is desirable, if possible, that<br/>bishops be ordained on Sundays and other feasts of our Lord or on the<br/>feasts of apostles or evangelists.</i></p>
<p><i>When a bishop is to be ordained, the Presiding Bishop of this Church,<br/>or a bishop appointed by the Presiding Bishop, presides and serves as<br/>chief consecrator.  At least two other bishops are co-consecrators.<br/>Representatives of the presbyterate, diaconate, and laity of the diocese<br/>for which the new bishop is to be consecrated, are assigned appropriate<br/>duties in the service.</i></p>
<p><i>From the beginning of the service until the Offertory, the chief<br/>consecrator presides from a chair placed close to the people, so that<br/>all may see and hear what is done.  The other bishops, or a convenient<br/>number of them, sit to the right and left of the chief consecrator.</i></p>
<p><i>The bishop-elect is vested in a rochet or alb, without stole, tippet,<br/>or other vesture distinctive of ecclesiastical or academic rank or<br/>order.</i></p>
<p><i>When the bishop-elect is presented, his full name (designated by the<br/>symbol <b><span class="person">N</span></b><b><span class="person">N</span></b>) is used.  Thereafter, it is appropriate to refer to him<br/>only by the Christian name by which he wishes to be known.</i></p>
<p><i>At the Offertory, it is appropriate that the bread and wine be brought<br/>to the Altar by the family or friends of the newly ordained.</i></p>
<p><i>The family of the newly ordained may receive Communion before other<br/>members of the congregation.  Opportunity is always given to the people<br/>to communicate.</i></p>
