<p>Let us pray for the Church and for the world.</p>
<p>Grant, Almighty God, that all who confess your Name may<br/>be united in your truth, live together in your love, and reveal<br/>your glory in the world.</p>
<p><i>Silence</i></p>
<p>Lord, in your mercy<br/><i>Hear our prayer.</i></p>
<p>Guide the people of this land, and of all the nations, in the<br/>ways of justice and peace; that we may honor one another<br/>and serve the common good.</p>
<p><i>Silence</i></p>
<p>Lord, in your mercy<br/><i>Hear our prayer.</i></p>
<p>Give us all a reverence for the earth as your own creation,<br/>that we may use its resources rightly in the service of others<br/>and to your honor and glory.</p>
<p><i>Silence</i></p>
<p>Lord, in your mercy<br/><i>Hear our prayer.</i></p>
<p>Bless all whose lives are closely linked with ours, and grant<br/>that we may serve Christ in them, and love one another as he<br/>loves us.</p>
