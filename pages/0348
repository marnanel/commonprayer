<p><i>A Saint</i></p>
<p>For the wonderful grace and virtue declared in all thy saints,<br/>who have been chosen vessels of thy grace, and the lights<br/>of the world in their generations.</p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>Who in the obedience of thy saints hast given us an example<br/>of righteousness, and in their eternal joy a glorious pledge of<br/>the hope of our calling.</p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>Because thou are greatly glorified in the assembly of thy saints.<br/>All thy creatures praise thee, and thy faithful servants bless<br/>thee, confessing before the rulers of this world the great Name<br/>of thine only Son.</p>
<p><i>Apostles and Ordinations</i></p>
<p>Through the great shepherd of thy flock, Jesus Christ our<br/>Lord; who after his resurrection sent forth his apostles to<br/>preach the Gospel and to teach all nations; and promised to<br/>be with them always, even unto the end of the ages.</p>
<p><i>Dedication of a Church</i></p>
<p>Through Jesus Christ our great High Priest; in whom we are<br/>build up as living stones of a holy temple, that we might offer<br/>before thee a sacrifice of praise and prayer which is holy and<br/>pleasing in thy sight.</p>
<p><i>Baptism</i></p>
<p>Because in Jesus Christ our Lord thou hast received us as thy<br/>sons and daughters, made us citizens of thy kingdom, and<br/>given us the Holy Spirit to guide us into all truth.</p>
