<p>Hear what our Lord Jesus saith:</p>
<p>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with<br/>all thy soul, and with all thy mind.  This is the first and great<br/>commandment.  And the second is like unto it:  Thou shalt<br/>love thy neighbor as thyself.  On these two commandments<br/>hang all the Law and the Prophets.  <i><a href="bible:Matthew+22%3A37-40">Matthew 22:37-40</a></i></p>
