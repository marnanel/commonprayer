<p>O God, who hast caused this holy night to shine with the<br/>illumination of the true Light:  Grant us, we beseech thee,<br/>that as we have known the mystery of that Light upon earth,<br/>so may we also perfectly enjoy him in heaven; where with<br/>thee and the Holy Spirit he liveth and reigneth, one God, in<br/>glory everlasting.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, who hast given us thy only-begotten Son to<br/>take our nature upon him, and as at this time to be born of a<br/>pure virgin:  Grant that we, being regenerate and made thy<br/>children by adoption and grace, may daily be renewed by thy<br/>Holy Spirit; through the same our Lord Jesus Christ, who<br/>liveth and reigneth with thee and the same Spirit ever, one<br/>God, world without end.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<h1>First Sunday after Christmas Day</h1>
<p><i>This Sunday takes precedence over the three Holy Days which follow<br/>Christmas Day.  As necessary, the observance of one, two, or all three<br/>of them, is postponed one day.</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, who hast poured upon us the new light of<br/>thine incarnate Word:  Grant that the same light, enkindled in<br/>our hearts, may shine forth in our lives; through the same<br/>Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee, in<br/>the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.<br/><i>Amen.</i></p>
