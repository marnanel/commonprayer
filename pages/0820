<p>Almighty God, who hast given us this good land for our<br/>heritage:  We humbly beseech thee that we may always prove<br/>ourselves a people mindful of thy favor and glad to do thy will.<br/>Bless our land with honorable industry, sound learning, and<br/>pure manners.  Save us from violence, discord, and confusion;<br/>from pride and arrogance, and from every evil way.  Defend<br/>our liberties, and fashion into one united people the multitudes<br/>brought hither out of many kindreds and tongues.  Endue<br/>with the spirit of wisdom those to whom in thy Name we entrust<br/>the authority of government, that there may be justice and<br/>peace at home, and that, through obedience to thy law, we<br/>may show forth thy praise among the nations of the earth.<br/>In the time of prosperity, fill our hearts with thankfulness,<br/>and in the day of trouble, suffer not our trust in thee to fail;<br/>all which we ask through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p>O Lord our Governor, whose glory is in all the world:  We<br/>commend this nation to <i>thy</i> merciful care, that, being guided<br/>by <i>thy</i> Providence, we may dwell secure in <i>thy</i> peace.

Fill them with the<br/>love of truth and righteousness, and make them ever mindful<br/>of their calling to serve this people in <i>thy</i> fear; through Jesus<br/>Christ our Lord, who <i>liveth</i> and <i>reigneth</i> with <i>thee</i> and the<br/>Holy Spirit, one God, world without end.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
