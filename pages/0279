<p>increase, until the earth is filled with the knowledge of your<br/>love; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>Let us pray for all who suffer and are afflicted in body or in mind;</p>
<p>For the hungry and the homeless, the destitute  and the oppressed</p>
<p>For the sick, the wounded, and the crippled</p>
<p>For those in loneliness, fear, and anguish</p>
<p>For those who face temptation, doubt, and despair</p>
<p>For the sorrowful and bereaved</p>
<p>For prisoners and captives, and those in mortal danger</p>
<p>That God in his mercy will comfort and relieve them, and<br/>grant them the knowledge of his love, and stir up in us the<br/>will and patience to minister to their needs.</p>
<p><i>Silence</i></p>
<p>Gracious God, the comfort of all who sorrow, the strength of<br/>all who suffer: Let the cry of those in misery and need come<br/>to you, that they may find your mercy present with them in all<br/>their afflictions; and give us, we pray, the strength to serve<br/>them for the sake of him who suffered for us, your Son Jesus<br/>Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>Let us pray for all who have not received the Gospel of Christ;</p>
<p>For those who have never heard the word of salvation</p>
<p>For those who have lost their faith</p>
<p>For those hardened by sin or indifference</p>
<p>For the contemptuous and the scornful</p>
<p>For those who are enemies of the cross of Christ and persecutors of<br/>his disciples</p>
<p>For those who in the name of Christ have persecuted others</p>
<p>That God will open their hearts to the truth, and lead them to<br/>faith and obedience.</p>
