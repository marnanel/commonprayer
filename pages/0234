<p>Almighty and everlasting God, you are always more ready to<br/>hear than we to pray, and to give more than we either desire<br/>or deserve:  Pour upon us the abundance of your mercy,<br/>forgiving us those things of which our conscience is afraid,<br/>and giving us those good things for which we are not worthy<br/>to ask, except through the merits and mediation of Jesus<br/>Christ our Savior; who lives and reigns with you and the<br/>Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
