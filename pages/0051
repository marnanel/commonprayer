<p>That we should be saved from our enemies, *<br/> and from the hand of all that hate us;</p>
<p>To perform the mercy promised to our forefathers, *<br/> and to remember his holy covenant;</p>
<p>To perform the oath which he sware to our forefather Abraham, *<br/> that he would give us,</p>
<p>That we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies *<br/> might serve him without fear,</p>
<p>In holiness and righteousness before him, *<br/> all the days of our life.</p>
<p>And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest, *<br/> for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord<br/>  to prepare his ways;</p>
<p>To give knowledge of salvation unto his people *<br/> for the remission of their sins,</p>
<p>Through the tender mercy of our God, *<br/> whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us;</p>
<p>To give light to them that sit in darkness<br/>and in the shadow of death, *<br/> and to guide our feet into the way of peace.</p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br/> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.</p>

<p>Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, *<br/> according to thy word;</p>
<p>For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, *<br/> which thou hast prepared before the face of all people,</p>
<p>To be a light to lighten the Gentiles, *<br/> and to be the glory of thy people Israel.</p>
