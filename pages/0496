<p>In the assurance of eternal life given at Baptism, let us<br/>proclaim our faith and say,</p>
<p><i>Celebrant and People</i></p>
<p>I believe in God, the Father almighty,<br/> creator of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.<br/> He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit<br/>  and born of the Virgin Mary.<br/> He suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br/> was crucified, died, and was buried.<br/> He descended to the dead.<br/> On the third day he rose again.<br/> He ascended into heaven,<br/>  and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br/> He will come again to judge the living and the dead.</p>
<p>I believe in the Holy Spirit,<br/> the holy catholic Church,<br/> the communion of saints,<br/> the forgiveness of sins,<br/> the resurrection of the body,<br/> and the life everlasting.  Amen.</p>
