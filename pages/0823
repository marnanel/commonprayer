<p><i>25.  For those in the Armed Forces of our Country</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, we commend to your gracious care and<br/>keeping all the men and women of our armed forces at home<br/>and abroad.  Defend them day by day with your heavenly<br/>grace; strengthen them in their trials and temptations; give<br/>them courage to face the perils which beset them; and grant<br/>them a sense of your abiding presence wherever they may be;<br/>through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>26.  For those who suffer for the sake of Conscience</i></p>
<p>O God our Father, whose Son forgave his enemies while he<br/>was suffering shame and death: Strengthen those who suffer<br/>for the sake of conscience; when they are accused, save them<br/>from speaking in hate; when they are rejected, save them<br/>from bitterness; when they are imprisoned, save them from<br/>despair; and to us your servants, give grace to respect their<br/>witness and to discern the truth, that our society may be<br/>cleansed and strengthened.  This we ask for the sake of Jesus<br/>Christ, our merciful and righteous Judge.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p>Grant, O God, that your holy and life-giving Spirit may so<br/>move every human heart [and especially the hearts of the<br/>people of this land], that barriers which divide us may<br/>crumble, suspicions disappear, and hatreds cease; that our<br/>divisions being healed, we may live in justice and peace;<br/>through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
