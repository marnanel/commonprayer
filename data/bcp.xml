<![CDATA[<h1>The Ratification of the Book of Common Prayer (1789)</h1>
<p>By the Bishops, the Clergy, and the Laity of the Protestant Episcopal<br/>Church in the United States of America, in Convention, this Sixteenth<br/>Day of October, in the Year of Our Lord One Thousand Seven Hundred<br/>and Eighty-Nine.</p>
<p>This Convention having, in their present session, set forth <i>A Book of<br/>Common Prayer, and Administration of the Sacraments, and other Rites<br/>and Ceremonies of the Church,</i> do hereby establish the said Book:  And<br/>they declare it to be the Liturgy of this Church: And require that it be<br/>received as such by all the members of the same:  And this Book shall be<br/>in use from and after the First Day of October, in the Year of Our Lord<br/>one thousand seven hundred and ninety.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>It is a most invaluable part of that blessed "liberty wherewith Christ<br/>hath made us free," that in his worship different forms and usages may<br/>without offense be allowed, provided the substance of the Faith be kept<br/>entire; and that, in every Church, what cannot be clearly determined to<br/>belong to Doctrine must be referred to Discipline; and therefore, by<br/>common consent and authority, may be altered, abridged, enlarged,<br/>amended, or otherwise disposed of, as may seem most convenient for the<br/>edification of the people, "according to the various exigency of times<br/>and occasions."</p>
<p>The Church of England, to which the Protestant Episcopal Church in<br/>these States is indebted, under God, for her first foundation and a long<br/>continuance of nursing care and protection, hath, in the Preface of her<br/>Book of Common Prayer, laid it down as a rule, that "The particular<br/>Forms of Divine Worship, and the Rites and Ceremonies appointed to be<br/>used therein, being things in their own nature indifferent, and<br/>alterable, and so acknowledged; it is but reasonable that upon weighty<br/>and important considerations, according to the various exigency of times<br/>and occasions, such changes and alterations should be made therein, as<br/>to those that are in place of Authority should, from time to time, seem<br/>either necessary or expedient."</p>
<p>The same Church hath not only in her Preface, but likewise in her<br/>Articles and Homilies, declared tho necessity and expediency of<br/>occasional alterations and amendments in her Forms of Public Worship;<br/>and we find accordingly, that, seeking to keep the happy mean between<br/>too much stiffness in refusing, and too much easiness in admitting<br/>variations in</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>things once advisedly established, she hath, in the reign of several<br/>Princes, since the first compiling of her Liturgy in the time of Edward<br/>the Sixth, upon just and weighty considerations her thereunto moving,<br/>yielded to make such alterations in some particulars, as in their<br/>respective times were thought convenient; yet so as that the main body<br/>and essential parts of the same (as well in the chiefest materials, as<br/>in the frame and order thereof) have still been continued firm and<br/>unshaken</p>
<p>Her general aim in these different reviews and alterations hath been, as<br/>she further declares in her said Preface, to do that which, according to<br/>her best understanding, might most tend to the preservation of peace and<br/>unity in the Church; the procuring of reverence, and the exciting of<br/>piety and devotion in the worship of God; and, finally, the cutting off<br/>occasion, from them that seek occasion, of cavil or quarrel against her<br/>Liturgy.  And although, according to her judgment, there be not any<br/>thing in it contrary to the Word of God, or to sound doctrine, or which<br/>a godly man may not with a good conscience use and submit unto, or which<br/>is not fairly defensible, if allowed such just and favourable<br/>construction as in common equity ought to be allowed to all human<br/>writings; yet upon the principles already laid down, it cannot but be<br/>supposed that further alterations would be found expedient.<br/>Accordingly, a Commission for a review was issued in the year 1689:  but<br/>this great and good work miscarried at that time; and the Civil<br/>Authority has not since thought proper to revive it by any new<br/>Commission.</p>
<p>But when in the course of Divine Providence, these American States<br/>became independent with respect to civil government, their<br/>ecclesiastical independence was necessarily included; and the different<br/>religious denominations of Christians in these States were left at full<br/>and equal liberty to model and organize their respective Churches, and<br/>forms of worship, and discipline, in such manner as they might judge<br/>most convenient for their future prosperity; consistently with the<br/>constitution and laws of their country.</p>
<p>The attention of this Church was in the first place drawn to those<br/>alterations in the Liturgy which became necessary in the prayers for our<br/>Civil Rulers, in consequence of the Revolution.  And the principal care<br/>herein was to make them conformable to what ought to be the proper<br/>end of all such prayers, namely, that "Rulers may have grace, wisdom,</p>]]>

    <content>
<![CDATA[<p>and understanding to execute justice, and to maintain truth;" and that<br/>the people "may lead quiet and peaceable lives, in all godliness and<br/>honesty."</p>
<p>But while these alterations were in review before the Convention, they<br/>could not but, with gratitude to God, embrace the happy occasion which<br/>was offered to them (uninfluenced and unrestrained by any worldly<br/>authority whatsoever) to take a further review of the Public Service,<br/>and to establish such other alterations and amendments therein as might<br/>be deemed expedient.</p>
<p>It seems unnecessary to enumerate all the different alterations and<br/>amendments.  They will appear, and it is to be hoped, the reasons of<br/>them also, upon a comparison of this with the Book of Common Prayer of<br/>the Church of England.  In which it will also appear that this Church is<br/>far from intending to depart from the Church of England in any essential<br/>point of doctrine, discipline, or worship; or further than local<br/>circumstances require.</p>
<p>And now, this important work being brought to a conclusion, it is hoped<br/>the whole will be received and examined by every true member of our<br/>Church, and every sincere Christian, with a meek, candid, and charitable<br/>frame of mind; without prejudice or prepossessions; seriously<br/>considering what Christianity is, and what the truths of the Gospel are;<br/>and earnestly beseeching Almighty God to accompany with his blessing<br/>every endeavour for promulgating them to mankind in the clearest,<br/>plainest, most affecting and majestic manner, for the sake of Jesus<br/>Christ, our blessed Lord and Saviour.</p>

    <content>
<![CDATA[<h1>Concerning the Service<br/>of the Church</h1>
<p>The Holy Eucharist, the principal act of Christian worship on the Lord's<br/>Day and other major Feasts, and Daily Morning and Evening Prayer, as<br/>set forth in this Book, are the regular services appointed for public<br/>worship in the Church.</p>
<p>In addition to these services and the other rites contained in this<br/>Book, other forms set forth by authority within this Church may be used.<br/>Also, subject to the direction of the bishop, special devotions taken<br/>from this Book, or from Holy Scripture, may be used when the needs of<br/>the  congregation so require.</p>
<p>For special days of thanksgiving, appointed by civil or Church<br/>authority, and for other special occasions for which no service or<br/>prayer has been provided in this Book, the bishop may set forth such<br/>forms as are fitting to the occasion.</p>
<p>In all services, the entire Christian assembly participates in such a<br/>way that the members of each order within the Church, lay persons,<br/>bishops, priests, and deacons, fulfull the functions proper to their<br/>respective orders, as set forth in the rubrical directions for each<br/>service.</p>
<p>The leader of worship in a Christian assembly is normally a bishop or<br/>priest.  Deacons by virtue of their order do not exercise a presiding<br/>function; but, like lay persons, may officiate in the Liturgy of the<br/>Word, whether in the form provided in the Daily Office, or (when a<br/>bishop or priest is not present) in the form appointed at the Eucharist.<br/>Under exceptional circumstances, when the services of a priest cannot be<br/>obtained, the bishop may, at discretion, authorize a deacon to preside</p>]]>

    <content>
<![CDATA[<p>at other rites also, subject to the limitations described in the<br/>directions for each service.</p>
<p>In any of the Proper Liturgies for Special Days, and in other services<br/>contained within this Book celebrated in the context of a Rite One<br/>service, the contemporary idiom may be conformed to traditional<br/>language.</p>
<p>Hymns referred to in the rubrics of this Book are understood as those<br/>authorized by this Church.  The words of anthems are to be from<br/>Holy Scripture, or from this Book, or from texts congruent with them.</p>
<p>On occasion, and as appropriate, instrumental music may be substituted<br/>for a hymn or anthem.</p>
<p>Where rubrics indicate that a part of a service is to be "said," it must<br/>be understood to include "or sung," and <i>vice versa.</i></p>
<p>When it is desired to use music composed for them, previously authorized<br/>liturgical texts may be used in place of the corresponding texts in this<br/>Book.</p>
<p>Scriptural citations in this Book, except for the Psalms, follow the<br/>numeration of the Revised Standard Version of the Bible.</p>]]>

    <content>
<![CDATA[<h1>The Calendar<br/>of the Church Year</h1>
<p>The Church Year consists of two cycles of feasts and holy days:  one is<br/>dependent upon the movable date of the Sunday of the Resurrection or<br/>Easter Day; the other, upon the fixed date of December 25, the Feast of<br/>our Lord's Nativity or Christmas Day.</p>
<p>Easter Day is always the first Sunday after the full moon that falls on<br/>or after March 21.  It cannot occur before March 22 or after April 25.</p>
<p>The sequence of all Sundays of the Church Year depends upon the date of<br/>Easter Day.  But the Sundays of Advent are always the four Sundays<br/>before Christmas Day, whether it occurs on a Sunday or a weekday.  The<br/>date of Easter also determines the beginning of Lent on Ash Wednesday,<br/>and the feast of the Ascension on a Thursday forty days after Easter<br/>Day.</p>
<h1>1.  Principal Feasts</h1>
<p>The Principal Feasts observed in this Church are the following:</p>
<p>Easter Day</p>
<p>Ascension Day</p>
<p>The Day of Pentecost</p>
<p>Trinity Sunday</p>
<p>All Saint's Day : November 1</p>
<p>Christmas Day : December 25</p>
<p>The Epiphany : January 6</p>
<p>These feasts take precedence of any other day or observance.  All<br/>Saints' Day may always be observed on the Sunday following November 1,<br/>in addition to its observance on the fixed date.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<h1>2. Sundays</h1>
<p>All Sundays of the year are feasts of our Lord Jesus Christ.  In<br/>addition to the dated days listed above, only the following feasts,<br/>appointed on fixed days, take precedence of a Sunday:</p>
<p>The Holy Name</p>
<p>The Presentation</p>
<p>The Transfiguration</p>
<p>The feast of the Dedication of a Church, and the feast of its patron or<br/>title, may be observed on, or be transferred to, a Sunday, except in the<br/>seasons of Advent, Lent, and Easter.</p>
<p>All other Feasts of our Lord, and all other Major Feasts appointed on<br/>fixed days in the Calendar, when they occur on a Sunday, are normally<br/>transferred to the first convenient open day within the week.  When<br/>desired, however, the Collect, Preface, and one or more of the Lessons<br/>appointed for the Feast may be substituted for those of the Sunday, but<br/>not from the Last Sunday after Pentecost through the First Sunday after<br/>the Epiphany, or from the Last Sunday after the Epiphany through<br/>Trinity Sunday.</p>
<p>With the express permission of the bishop, and for urgent and sufficient<br/>reason, some other special occasion may be observed on a Sunday.</p>
<h1>3. Holy Days</h1>
<p>The following Holy Days are regularly observed throughout the year.<br/>Unless otherwise ordered in the preceding rules concerning Sundays, they<br/>have precedence over all other days of commemoration or of special<br/>observance:</p>

<p>The Holy Name</p>
<p>The Presentation</p>
<p>The Annunciation</p>

<p>Feasts appointed on fixed days in the Calendar do not take precedence of<br/>Ash Wednesday.</p>
<p>Feasts of our Lord and other Major Feasts appointed on fixed days,<br/>which fall upon or are transferred to a weekday, may be observed on any<br/>open day within the week.  This provision does not apply to Christmas<br/>Day, the Epiphany, and All Saints' Day.</p>

<p>Ash Wednesday and the other weekdays of Lent and of Holy Week,<br/>except the feast of the Annunciation.</p>

<p><i>The Officiant says to the people</i></p>
<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of<br/>Almighty God our heavenly Father, to render thanks for the<br/>great benefits that we have received at his hands, to set forth<br/>his most worthy praise, to hear this holy Word, and to ask, for<br/>ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are<br/>necessary for our life and our salvation.  And so that we may<br/>prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us<br/>kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts<br/>confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his<br/>infinite goodness and mercy.</p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>Let us humbly confess our sins unto Almighty God.</p>
<p><i>Silence may be kept.</i></p>
<p><i>Officiant and People together, all kneeling</i></p>
<p>Almighty and most merciful Father,<br/>we have erred and strayed from thy ways like lost sheep,<br/>we have followed too much the devices and desires of our<br/>  own hearts,<br/>we have offended against thy holy laws,<br/>we have left undone those things which we ought to<br/>  have done,</p>]]>

No one lights a lamp to put it under a<br/>bucket, but on a lamp-stand where it gives light for everyone<br/>in the house.

<p>O Lord God Almighty, as you have taught us to call the<br/>evening, the morning, and the noonday one day; and have<br/>made the sun to know its going down:  Dispel the darkness of<br/>our hearts, that by your brightness we may know you to be<br/>the true God and eternal light, living and reigning for ever<br/>and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<h1>Concerning the Proper<br/>of the Church Year</h1>
<p>The proper of the Church Year includes the appointed Collects, the<br/>Proper Prefaces, directions for which are to be found in the pages<br/>following; and the appointed Psalms and Lessons, which appear in tables<br/>beginning on page <a href="889.html">889</a>.</p>
<p>The Proper appointed for the Sunday is also used at celebrations of the<br/>Eucharist on the weekdays following, unless otherwise ordered for Holy<br/>Days and Various Occasions.</p>
<p>The Proper to be used on each of the Sundays after Pentecost (except for<br/>Trinity Sunday) is determined by the calendar date of that Sunday.  Thus,<br/>in any year, the Proper for the Sunday after Trinity Sunday (the Second<br/>Sunday after Pentecost) is the numbered Proper (number 3 through<br/>number 8), the calendar date of which falls on that Sunday, or is closest<br/>to it, whether before or after.  Thereafter, the Propers are used<br/>consecutively.

Three or more of the appointed Lessons are read before the Gospel,<br/>each followed by a Psalm, Canticle, or hymn.  Holy Baptism or<br/>Confirmation (beginning with the Presentation of the Candidates), or the<br/>Renewal of Baptismal Vows, page <a href="292.html">292</a>, follows the Sermon.</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, who on this day didst open the way of eternal<br/>life to every race and nation by the promised gift of thy Holy<br/>Spirit:  Shed abroad this gift throughout the world by the<br/>preaching of the Gospel, that it may reach to the ends of the<br/>earth; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth<br/>with thee, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever<br/>and ever.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>or this</i></p>
<p>O God, who on this day didst teach the hearts of thy faithful<br/>people by sending to them the light of thy Holy Spirit: Grant<br/>us by the same Spirit to have a right judgment in all things, and<br/>evermore to rejoice in his holy comfort; through the merits of<br/>Christ Jesus our Savior, who liveth and reigneth with thee, in<br/>the unity of the same Spirit, one God, world without end.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<![CDATA[<p>season of penitence and fasting.  This is season of Lent<br/>provided a time in which converts to the faith were prepared for Holy<br/>Baptism.  It was also a time when those who, because of<br/>notorious sins, had been separated from the body of the faithful<br/>were reconciled by penitence and forgiveness, and restored to<br/>the fellowship of the Church. Thereby, the whole congregation<br/>was put in mind of the message of pardon and absolution set<br/>forth in the Gospel of our Savior, and of the need which all<br/>Christians continually have to renew their repentance and faith.</p>
<p>I invite you, therefore, in the name of the Church, to the<br/>observance of a holy Lent, by self-examination and repentance;<br/>by prayer, fasting, and self-denial; and by reading and<br/>meditating on God's holy Word.  And, to make a right beginning<br/>of repentance, and as a mark of our mortal nature, let us now<br/>kneel before the Lord, our maker and redeemer.</p>
<p>*Silence is then kept for a time, all kneeling.</p>
<p>[[<i>If ashes are to be imposed, the Celebrant says the following prayer</i></p>
<p>Almighty God, you have created us out of the dust of the<br/>earth:  Grant that these ashes may be to us a sign of our<br/>mortality and penitence, that we may remember that it is<br/>only by your gracious gift that we are given everlasting life;<br/>through Jesus Christ our Savior.   <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p>Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who<br/>desires not the death of sinners, but rather that they may turn<br/>from their wickedness and live, has given power and<br/>commandment to his ministers to declare and pronounce to<br/>his people, being penitent, the absolution and remission of<br/>their sins.  He pardons and absolves all those who truly<br/>repent, and with sincere hearts believe his holy Gospel.</p>
<p>Therefore we beseech him to grant us true repentance and his<br/>Holy Spirit, that those things may please him which we do on<br/>this day, and that the rest of our life hereafter may be pure<br/>and holy, so that at the last we may come to his eternal joy;<br/>through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>

<![CDATA[<h1>Concerning the Vigil</h1>
<p><i>The Great Vigil, when observed, is the first service of Easter Day. It<br/>is celebrated at a convenient time between sunset on Holy Saturday and<br/>sunrise on Easter Morning.</i></p>
<p><i>The service normally consists of four parts:</i></p>
<p>1.  The Service of Light.</p>
<p>2.  The Service of Lessons.</p>
<p>3.  Christian Initiation, or the Renewal of Baptismal Vows.</p>
<p>4.  The Holy Eucharist with the administration of Easter Communion.</p>
<p><i>It is customary for all the ordained ministry present, together with<br/>lay readers, singers, and other persons, to take active parts in the<br/>service.</i></p>
<p><i>The bishop, when present, is the chief celebrant, presides at Baptism<br/>and administers Communion, and normally preaches the sermon.</i></p>
<p><i>The priests who are present share among them the reading of the<br/>Collects which follow each Lesson, and assist at Baptism and the<br/>Eucharist.  In the absence of a bishop, a priest presides at the<br/>service.</i></p>
<p><i>It is the prerogative of a deacon to carry the Paschal Candle to its<br/>place, and to chant the Exsultet.  Deacons likewise assist at Baptism<br/>and the Eucharist according to their order.</i></p>
<p><i>Lay persons should read the Lessons and the Epistle, and assist in<br/>other ways.  A lay person may be assigned to chant the Exsultet.  It is<br/>desirable that each Lesson be read by a different reader.</i></p>
<p><i>In the absence of a bishop or priest, a deacon or lay reader may lead<br/>the first two parts of the service, the Renewal of Baptismal Vows, and<br/>the Ministry of the Word of the Vigil Eucharist, concluding with the<br/>Prayers of the People, the Lord's Prayer, and the Dismissal.</i></p>
<p><i>A deacon may also, when the services of a priest cannot be obtained,<br/>and with the authorization of the bishop, officiate at public Baptism;<br/>and may administer Easter Communion from the Sacrament previously<br/>consecrated.</i></p>
<p><i>When the Vigil is not celebrated, the Service of Light may take place<br/>at a convenient time before the Liturgy on Easter Day.</i></p>]]>

<h1>The Lighting of the Paschal Candle</h1>
<p><i>In the darkness, fire is kindled; after which the Celebrant may address<br/>the people in these or similar words</i></p>
<p>Dear friends in Christ: On this most holy night, in which our<br/>Lord Jesus passed over from death to life, the Church invites<br/>her members, dispersed throughout the world, to gather in<br/>vigil and prayer.  For this is the Passover of the Lord, in which,<br/>by hearing his Word and celebrating his Sacraments, we share<br/>in his victory over death.</p>
<p><i>The Celebrant may say the following prayer</i></p>
<p>Let us pray.</p>
<p>O God, through your Son you have bestowed upon your<br/>people the brightness of your light: Sanctify this new fire, and<br/>grant that in this Paschal feast we may so burn with heavenly<br/>desires, that with pure minds we may attain to the festival of<br/>everlasting light; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>The Paschal Candle is then lighted from the newly kindled fire, and the<br/>Deacon (the Celebrant if there is no deacon) bearing the Candle, leads<br/>the procession to the chancel, pausing three times and singing or<br/>saying</i></p>
<p>The light of Christ.</p>

<p><i>Holy Baptism (beginning with the Presentation of the Candidates,<br/>page <a href="305.html">305</a>, and concluding with the reception of the newly baptized) may<br/>be administered here or after the Gospel.  Confirmation may also be<br/>administered.</i></p>

<p>Through the Paschal mystery, dear friends, we are buried<br/>with Christ by Baptism into his death, and raised with him to<br/>newness of life.  I call upon you, therefore, now that our<br/>Lenten observance is ended, to renew the solemn promises<br/>and vows of Holy Baptism, by which we once renounced<br/>Satan and all his works, and promised to serve God faithfully<br/>in his holy Catholic Church.</p>

<![CDATA[<h1>Concerning the Service</h1>
<p><i>Holy Baptism is full initiation by water and the Holy Spirit into<br/>Christ's Body the Church.  The bond which God establishes in Baptism<br/>is indissoluble.</i></p>
<p><i>Holy Baptism is appropriately administered within the Eucharist as the<br/>chief service on a Sunday or other feast.</i></p>
<p><i>The bishop, when present, is the celebrant; and is expected to preach<br/>the Word and preside at Baptism and the Eucharist.  At Baptism, the<br/>bishop officiates at the Presentation and Examination of Candidates;<br/>says the Thanksgiving over the Water; [consecrates the Chrism;] reads<br/>the prayer, "Heavenly Father, we thank you that by water and the Holy<br/>Spirit;" and officiates at what follows.</i></p>
<p><i>In the absence of a bishop, a priest is the celebrant and presides at<br/>the service.  If a priest uses Chrism in signing the newly baptized, it<br/>must have been previously consecrated by the bishop.</i></p>
<p><i>Each candidate for Holy Baptism is to be sponsored by one or more<br/>baptized persons.</i></p>
<p><i>Sponsors of adults and older children present their candidates and<br/>thereby signify their endorsement of the candidates and their intention<br/>to support them by prayer and example in their Christian life.  Sponsors<br/>of infants, commonly called godparents, present their candidates, make<br/>promises in their own names, and also take vows on behalf of their<br/>candidates.</i></p>
<p><i>It is fitting that parents be included among the godparents of their<br/>own children.  Parents and godparents are to be instructed in the<br/>meaning of Baptism, in their duties to help the new Christians grow in<br/>the knowledge and love of God, and in their responsibilities as members<br/>of his Church.</i></p>

<![CDATA[<h1>Additional Directions</h1>
<p><i>Holy Baptism is especially appropriate at the Easter Vigil, on the<br/>Day of Pentecost, on All Saints' Day or the Sunday after All Saints'<br/>Day, and on the Feast of the Baptism of our Lord (the First Sunday<br/>after the Epiphany).  It is recommended that, as far as possible,<br/>Baptisms be reserved for these occasions or when a bishop is<br/>present.</i></p>
<p><i>If on any one of the above-named days the ministry of a bishop or<br/>priest cannot be obtained, the bishop may specially authorize a<br/>deacon to preside.  In that case, the deacon omits the prayer over<br/>the candidates, page <a href="308.html">308</a>, and the formula and action which follow.</i></p>
<p><i>These omitted portions of the rite may be administered on some<br/>subsequent occasion of public baptism at which a bishop or priest<br/>presides.</i></p>
<p><i>If on the four days listed above there are no candidates for Baptism,<br/>the Renewal of Baptismal vows, page <a href="292.html">292</a>, may take the place of the<br/>Nicene Creed at the Eucharist.</i></p>
<p><i>If desired, the hymn Gloria in excelsis may be sung immediately after<br/>the opening versicles and before the salutation "The Lord be with you."</i></p>
<p><i>When a bishop is present, or on other occasions for sufficient reason,<br/>the Collect (page <a href="203.html">203</a> or 254) and one or more of the Lessons provided<br/>for use at Baptism (page <a href="928.html">928</a>) may be substituted for the Proper of the<br/>Day.</i></p>
<p><i>Lay persons may act as readers, and it is appropriate for sponsors to<br/>be assigned this function.  The petitions (page <a href="303.html">303</a>) map also be led by<br/>one of the sponsors.</i></p>
<p><i>The Nicene Creed is not used at this service.</i></p>
<p><i>If the Presentation of the Candidates does not take place at the font,<br/>then before or during the petitions (page <a href="305.html">305</a>), the ministers,<br/>candidates, and sponsors go to the font for the Thanksgiving over the<br/>Water.</i></p>
<p><i>If the movement to the font is a formal procession, a suitable psalm,<br/>such as <a href="bible:Psalm+42">Psalm 42</a>, or a hymn or anthem, may be sung.</i></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p><i>Where practicable, the font is to be filled with clean water<br/>immediately before the Thanksgiving over the Water.</i></p>
<p><i>At the Thanksgiving over the Water, and at the administration of<br/>Baptism, the celebrant, whenever possible, should face the people across<br/>the font, and the sponsors should be so grouped that the people may have<br/>a clear view of the action.</i></p>
<p><i>After the Baptism, a candle (which may be lifted from the Paschal<br/>Candle) may be given to each of the newly baptized or to a godparent.</i></p>
<p><i>It may be found desirable to return to the front of the church for the<br/>prayer, "Heavenly Father, we thank you that by water and the Holy<br/>Spirit," and the ceremonies that follow it.  A suitable psalm, such as<br/><a href="bible:Psalm+23">Psalm 23</a>, or a hymn or anthem, may be sung during the procession.</i></p>
<p><i>The oblations of bread and wine at the baptismal Eucharist may be<br/>presented by the newly baptized or their godparents.</i></p>
<h1>Conditional Baptism</h1>
<p><i>If there is reasonable doubt that a person has been baptized with<br/>water, "In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy<br/>Spirit" (which are the essential parts of Baptism), the person is<br/>baptized in the usual manner, but this form of words is used</i></p>
<p>If you are not already baptized, <b><span class="person">N</span></b>, I baptize you in the<br/>Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h1>Emergency Baptism</h1>
<p><i>In case of emergency, any baptized person may administer Baptism<br/>according to the following form.</i></p>
<p><i>Using the given name of the one baptized (if known), pour water on<br/>him or her, saying</i></p>
<p>I baptize you in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and<br/>of the Holy Spirit.</p>]]>

<p>*Other prayers, such as the following, may be added</p>
<p>Heavenly Father, we thank you that by water and the Holy<br/>Spirit you have bestowed on upon this your servant the<br/>forgiveness of sin and have raised <i>him</i> to the new life of<br/>grace.  Strengthen <i>him,</i> O Lord, with your presence, enfold<br/><i>him</i> in the arms of your mercy, and keep <i>him</i> safe forever.</p>
<p><i>The person who administers emergency Baptism should inform the priest<br/>of the appropriate parish, so that the fact can be properly recorded.</i></p>
<p><i>If the baptized person recovers, the Baptism should be recognized<br/>at a public celebration of the Sacrament with a bishop or priest<br/>presiding, and the person baptized under emergency conditions,<br/>together with the sponsors or godparents, taking part in everything<br/>except the administration of the water.</i></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<h1>An Exhortation</h1>
<p><i>This Exhortation may be used, in whole or in part, either during the<br/>Liturgy or at other times.  In the absence of a deacon or priest, this<br/>Exhortation may be read by a lay person.  The people stand or sit.</i></p>
<p>Beloved in the Lord: Our Savior Christ, on the night before<br/>he suffered, instituted the Sacrament of his Body and<br/>Blood as a sign and pledge of his love, for the continual<br/>remembrance of the sacrifice of his death, and for a spiritual<br/>sharing in his risen life.  For in these holy Mysteries we are<br/>made one with Christ, and Christ with us; we are made one<br/>body in him, and members one of another.</p>
<p>Having in mind, therefore, his great love for us, and in<br/>obedience to his command, his Church renders to Almighty<br/>God our heavenly Father never-ending thanks for the<br/>creation of the world, for his continual providence over us,<br/>for his love for all mankind, and for the redemption of the<br/>world by our Savior Christ, who took upon himsely our flesh,<br/>and humbled himself even to death on the cross, that he<br/>might make us the children of God by the power of the Holy<br/>Spirit, and exalt us to everlasting life.</p>
<p>But if we are to share rightly in the celebration of those holy<br/>Mysteries, and be nourished by that spritual Food, we must remember<br/>the dignity of that holy Sacrament.  I therefore call<br/>upon you to consider how Saint Paul exhorts all persons to<br/>prepare themselves carefully before eating of that Bread and<br/>drinking of that Cup.</p>
<p>For, as the benefit is great, if with penitent hearts and living<br/>faith we receive the holy Sacrament, so is the danger great, if<br/>we receive it improperly, not recognizing the Lord's Body.<br/>Judge yourselves, therefore, lest you me judged by the Lord.</p>]]>

And acknowledge your sins before<br/>Almighty God, with full purpose of amendment of life, being<br/>ready to make restitution for all injuries and wrongs done by<br/>you to others; and also being ready to forgive those who have<br/>offended you, in order that you yourselves may be forgiven.<br/>And then, being reconciled with one another, come to the<br/>banquet of that most heavenly Food.</p>
<p>And if, in your preparation, you need help and counsel, then<br/>go and open your grief to a discreet and understanding priest,<br/>and confess your sins, that you may receive the benefit of<br/>absolution, and spiritual counsel and advice; to the removal<br/>of scruple and doubt, the assurance of pardon, and the<br/>strengthening of your faith.</p>
<p>To Christ our Lord who loves us, and washed us in his own<br/>blood, and made us a kingdom of priests to serve his God<br/>and Father, to him be glory in the Church evermore.  Through<br/>him let us offer continually the sacrifice of praise, which is<br/>our bounden duty and service, and, with faith in him, come<br/>boldly before the throne of grace [and humbly confess our<br/>sins to Almighty God].</p>

<p><i>It is the bishop's prerogative, when present, to be the principal<br/>celebrant at the Lord's Table, and to preach the Gospel.</i></p>
<p><i>At all celebrations of the Liturgy, it is fitting that the principal<br/>celebrant, whether bishop or priest, be assisted by other priests, and<br/>by deacons and lay persons.</i></p>
<p><i>It is appropriate that other priests present stand with the celebrant<br/>at the Altar, and join in the consecration of the gifts, in breaking the<br/>Bread, and in distributing Communion.</i></p>
<p><i>A deacon should read the Gospel and may lead the Prayers of the People.<br/>Deacons should also serve at the Lord's Table, preparing and placing on<br/>it the offerings of bread and wine, and assisting in the ministration of<br/>the sacrament to the people.  In the absence of a deacon, these duties<br/>may be performed by an assisting priest.</i></p>
<p><i>Lay persons appointed by the celebrant should normally be assigned the<br/>reading of the Lessons which precede the Gospel, and may lead the<br/>Prayers of the People.</i></p>
<p><i>Morning or Evening Prayer may be used in place of all that precedes the<br/>Peace and the Offertory, provided that a lesson from the Gospel is<br/>always included, and that the intercessions conform to the directions<br/>given for the Prayers of the People.</i></p>

<![CDATA[<h1>Concerning the Celebration</h1>
<p><i>It is the bishop's prerogative, when present, to be the principal<br/>celebrant at the Lord's Table, and to preach the Gospel.</i></p>
<p><i>At all celebrations of the Liturgy, it is fitting that the principal<br/>celebrant, whether bishop or priest, be assisted by other priests, and<br/>by deacons and lay persons.</i></p>
<p><i>It is appropriate that other priests present stand with the celebrant<br/>at the Altar, and join in the consecration of the gifts, in breaking the<br/>Bread, and in distributing Communion.</i></p>
<p><i>A deacon should read the Gospel and may lead the Prayers of the People.<br/>Deacons should also serve at the Lord's Table, preparing and placing on<br/>it the offerings of bread and wine, and assisting in the ministration of<br/>the sacrament to the people.  In the absence of a deacon, these duties<br/>may be performed by an assisting priest.</i></p>
<p><i>Lay persons appointed by the celebrant should normally be assigned the<br/>reading of the Lessons which precede the Gospel, and may lead the<br/>Prayers of the People.</i></p>
<p><i>Morning or Evening Prayer may be used in place of all that precedes the<br/>Peace and the Offertory, provided that a lesson from the Gospel is<br/>always included, and that the intercessions conform to the directions<br/>given for the Prayers of the People.</i></p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love<br/>which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling<br/>of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the<br/>prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your<br/>Son.  For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from<br/>the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world.<br/>In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy<br/>to stand before you.  In him, you have brought us out of error<br/>into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>

<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given<br/>thanks, he gave it to them, and said, "Drink this, all of you:<br/>This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you<br/>and for many for the forgiveness of sins.  Whenever you drink<br/>it, do this for the remembrance of me."</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Father, you loved the world so much that in the fullness of<br/>time you sent your only Son to be our Savior.  Incarnate by<br/>the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, he lived as one of<br/>us, yet without sin.  To the poor he proclaimed the good news<br/>of salvation; to prisoners, freedom; to the sorrowful, joy.  To<br/>fulfill your purpose he gave himself up to death; and, rising<br/>from the grave, destroyed death, and made the whole<br/>creation new.</p>
<p>And, that we might live no longer for ourselves, but for him<br/>who died and rose for us, he sent the Holy Spirit, his own<br/>first gift for those who believe, to complete his work in<br/>the world, and to bring to fulfillment the sanctification of all.</p>
<p><i>At the following words concerning the bread, the Celebrant is to hold<br/>it, or lay a hand upon it, and at the words concerning the cup, to hold<br/>or place a hand upon the cup and any other vessel containing wine to be<br/>consecrated.</i></p>
<p>When the hour had come for him to be glorified by you, his<br/>heavenly Father, having loved his own who were in the<br/>world, he loved them to the end; at supper with them he took<br/>bread, and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and<br/>gave it to his disciples, and said, "Take, eat: This is my Body,<br/>which is given for you.  Do this for the remembrance of me."</p>

<p>I appeal to you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present<br/>yourselves as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God,<br/>which is your spiritual worship.  <i><a href="bible:Romans+12%3A1">Romans 12:1</a></i></p>
<p>If you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember<br/>that your brother has something against you, leave your gift<br/>there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your<br/>brother, and then come and offer your gift.  <i><a href="bible:Matthew+5%3A23%2C24">Matthew 5:23, 24</a></i></p>

I am the vine, you are the<br/>branches.  By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much<br/>fruit, and so prove to be my disciples.

<p>And so, Father, we bring you these gifts.  Sanctify them by<br/>your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood<br/>of Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p><i>At the following words concerning the bread, the Celebrant is to hold<br/>it, or to lay a hand upon it; and at the words concerning the cup, to<br/>hold or place a hand upon the cup and any other vessel containing wine<br/>to be consecrated.</i></p>
<p>On the night he was betrayed he took bread, said the<br/>blessing, and gave it to his friends, and<br/>said, "Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you.<br/>Do this for the remembrance of me."</p>
<p>After supper, he took the cup of wine, gave thanks, and<br/>said, "Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new<br/>Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the<br/>forgiveness of sins.  Whenever you drink it, do this for the<br/>remembrance of me."</p>
<p>Father, we now celebrate the memorial of your Son.  By<br/>means of this holy bread and cup, we show forth the sacrifice<br/>of his death, and proclaims his resurrection, until he comes<br/>again.</p>
<p>Gather us by this Holy Communion into one body in your<br/>Son Jesus Christ.  Make us a living sacrifice of praise.</p>
<p>By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy<br/>Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and<br/>for ever.  AMEN.</p>]]>

<p><i>The Holy Table is spread with a clean white cloth during the<br/>celebration.</i></p>
<p><i>When the Great Litany is sung or said immediately before the Eucharist,<br/>the Litany concludes with the Kyries, and the Eucharist begins with the<br/>Salutation and the Collect of the Day.  The Prayers of the People<br/>following the Creed may be omitted.</i></p>
<p><i>When a psalm is used, it may be concluded with Gloria Patri.  In Rite<br/>One services, the following form of the Gloria may be used:</i></p>
<p>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,<br/> and to the Holy Ghost:</p>
<p>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br/> world without end.  Amen.</p>
<p><i>The Kyrie eleison (or "Lord, have mercy") may be sung or said in<br/>threefold, sixfold, or ninefold form.  The Trisagion, "Holy God", may be<br/>sung or said three times, or antiphonally.</i></p>
<p><i>Gloria in excelsis, or the hymn used in place of it, is sung or said<br/>from Christmas Day through the Feast of the Epiphany; on Sundays from<br/>Easter Day through the Day of Pentecost, on all the days of Easter Week,<br/>and on Ascension Day; and at other times as desired; but it is not used<br/>on the Sundays or ordinary weekdays of Advent or Lent.</i></p>
<p><i>It is desirable that the Lessons be read from a lectern or pulpit, and<br/>that the Gospel be read from the same lectern, or from the pulpit, or<br/>from the midst of the congregation.  It is desirable that the Lessons<br/>and the Gospel be read from a book or books of appropriate size and<br/>dignity.</i></p>
<p><i>When a portion of the congregation is composed of persons whose native<br/>tongue is other than English, a reader appointed by the celebrant may<br/>read the Gospel in the language of the people, either in place of, or in<br/>addition to, the Gospel in English.</i></p>

<p><i>In the absence of a priest, all that is described above, except for the<br/>blessing, may be said by a deacon, or, if there is no deacon, by a lay<br/>reader.</i></p>
<p><i>The greeting, "The peace of the Lord be always with you," is addressed<br/>to the entire assembly.  In the exchange between individuals which may<br/>follow, any appropriate words of greeting may be used.  If preferred,<br/>the exchange of the Peace may take place at the time of the<br/>administration of the Sacrament (before or after the sentence of<br/>Invitation).</i></p>
<p><i>Necessary announcements may be made before the service, after the<br/>Creed, before the Offertory, or at the end of the service, as<br/>convenient.</i></p>
<p><i>It is the function of a deacon to make ready the Table for the<br/>celebration, preparing and placing upon it the bread and wine.  It is<br/>customary to add a little water to the wine.  The deacon may be assisted<br/>by other ministers.</i></p>
<p><i>During the Great Thanksgiving, it is appropriate that there be only one<br/>chalice on the Altar, and, if need be, a flagon of wine from which<br/>additional chalices may be filled after the Breaking of the Bread.</i></p>
<p><i>The following anthem may be used at the Breaking of the Bread:</i></p>
<p>Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world:<br/> have mercy on us.</p>
<p>Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world:<br/> have mercy on us.</p>
<p>Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world:<br/> grant us peace.</p>
<p><i>While the people are coming forward to receive Communion, the celebrant<br/>receives the Sacrament in both kinds.  The bishops, priests, and deacons<br/>at the Holy Table then communicate, and after them the<br/>people.</i></p>
<p><i>Opportunity is always to be given to every communicant to receive the<br/>consecrated Bread and Wine separately.  But the Sacrament may be</i></p>]]>

<p><i>When the celebrant is assisted by a deacon or another priest, it is<br/>customary for the celebrant to administer the consecrated Bread and the<br/>assistant the Chalice.  When several deacons or priests are present,<br/>some may administer the Bread and others the Wine.  In the absence of<br/>sufficient deacons and priests, lay persons licensed by the bishop<br/>according to the canon may administer the Chalice.</i></p>
<p><i>If the consecrated Bread or Wine does not suffice for the number of<br/>communicants, the celebrant is to return to the Holy Table, and<br/>consecrate more of either or both, by saying</i></p>
<p>Hear us, O heavenly Father, and with thy (your) Word and<br/>Holy Spirit bless and sanctify this bread (wine) that it, also,<br/>may be the Sacrament of the precious Body (Blood) of thy<br/>(your) Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who took bread (the cup)<br/>and said, "This is my Body (Blood)."  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p><i>or else the celebrant may consecrate more of both kinds, saying again<br/>the words of the Eucharistic Prayer, beginning with the words which<br/>follow the Sanctus, and ending with the Invocation (in the case of<br/>Eucharistic Prayer C, ending with the narrative of the Institution).</i></p>
<p>*When the service of a priest cannot be obtained, the bishop may, at<br/>discretion, authorize a deacon to distribute Holy Communion to the<br/>congregation from the reserved Sacrament in the following manner:</p>
<p>1.  After the Liturgy of the Word (and the receiving of the people's<br/>offering), the deacon reverently places the consecrated Sacrament on the<br/>Altar, during which time a communion hymn may be sung.</p>
<p>2.  The Lord's Prayer is then said, the deacon first saying, "Let us<br/>pray in the words our Savior Christ hath (has) taught us."</p>
<p>3.  And then, omitting the breaking of the Bread, the deacon proceeds<br/>with what follows in the liturgy as far as the end of the postcommunion<br/>prayer, and then dismisses the people.*</p>
<p>*If any of the consecrated Bread or Wine remain, apart from any which<br/>may be required for the Communion of the sick, or of others who for</p>]]>

<p><i>A hymn may be sung before or after the postcommunion prayer.</i></p>
<p><i>Disciplinary Rubrics</i></p>
<p><i>If the priest knows that a person who is living a notoriously evil life<br/>intends to come to Communion, the priest shall speak to that person<br/>privately, and tell <i>him</i> that <i>he</i> may not come to the Holy Table until<br/><i>he</i> has given clear proof of repentance and amendment of life.</i></p>
<p><i>The priest shall follow the same procedure with those who have done<br/>wrong to their neighbors and are a scandal to the other members of the<br/>congregation, not allowing such persons to receive Communion until they<br/>have made restitution for the wrong they have done, or have at least<br/>promised to do so.</i></p>
<p><i>When the priest sees that there is hatred between members of the<br/>congregation, <i>he</i> shall speak privately to them, telling them that they<br/>may not receive Communion until they have forgiven each other. And if<br/>the person or persons on one side truly forgive the others and desire<br/>and promise to make up for their faults, but those on the other side<br/>refuse to forgive, the priest shall allow those who are penitent to come<br/>to Communion, but not those who are stubborn.</i></p>
<p><i>In all such cases, the priest is required to notify the bishop, within<br/>fourteen days at the most, giving the reasons for refusing Communion.</i></p>]]>

<p>Christian marriage is a solemn and public covenant between a man and a<br/>woman in the presence of God.  In the Episcopal Church it is required<br/>that one, at least, of the parties must be a baptized Christian; that<br/>the ceremony be attested by at least two witnesses; and that the<br/>marriage conform to the laws of the State and the canons of this<br/>Church.*</p>
<p><i>A priest or a bishop normally presides at the Celebration and Blessing<br/>of a Marriage, because such ministers alone have the function of<br/>pronouncing the nuptial blessing, and of celebrating the Holy<br/>Eucharist.</i></p>

<p><i>At the time appointed, the persons to be married, with their witnesses,<br/>assemble in the church or some other appropriate place.</i></p>
<p><i>During their entrance, a hymn, psalm, or anthem may be sung, or<br/>instrumental music may be played.</i></p>
<p><i>Then the Celebrant, facing the people and the persons to be married,<br/>with the woman to the right and the man to the left, addresses the<br/>congregation and says</i></p>
<p>Dearly beloved: We have come together in the presence of<br/>God to witness and bless the joining together of this man and<br/>this woman in Holy Matrimony.  The bond and covenant of<br/>marriage was established by God in creation, and our Lord<br/>Jesus Christ adorned this manner of life by his presence and<br/>first miracle at a wedding in Cana of Galilee.  It signifies to us<br/>the mystery of the union between Christ and his Church, and<br/>Holy Scripture commends it to be honored among all people.</p>
<p>The union of husband and wife in heart, body, and mind is<br/>intended by God for their mutual joy; for the help and comfort<br/>given one another in prosperity and adversity; and, when it is<br/>God's will, for the procreation of children and their nurture<br/>in the knowledge and love of the Lord.  Therefore marriage is<br/>not to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly, but reverently,<br/>deliberately, and in accordance with the purposes for which it<br/>was instituted by God.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<h1>Concerning the Rite</h1>
<p><i>The ministry of reconciliation, which has been committed by Christ to<br/>his Church, is exercised through the care each Christian has for others,<br/>through the common prayer of Christians assembled for public worship,<br/>and through the priesthood of Christ and his ministers declaring<br/>absolution.</i></p>
<p><i>The Reconciliation of a Penitent is available for all who desire it. It<br/>is not restricted to times of sickness.  Confessions may be heard<br/>anytime and anywhere.</i></p>
<p><i>Two equivalent forms of service are provided here to meet the needs of<br/>penitents.  The absolution in these services may be pronounced only by a<br/>bishop or priest.  Another Christian may be asked to hear a confession,<br/>but it must be made clear to the penitent that absolution will not be<br/>pronounced; instead, a declaration of forgiveness is provided.</i></p>
<p><i>When a confession is heard in a church building, the confessor may sit<br/>inside the altar rails or in a place set aside to give greater privacy,<br/>and the penitent kneels nearby.  If preferred, the confessor and<br/>penitent may sit face to face for a spiritual conference leading to<br/>absolution or a declaration of forgiveness.</i></p>
<p><i>When the penitent has confessed all serious sins troubling the<br/>conscience and has given evidence of due contrition, the priest gives<br/>such counsel and encouragement as are needed and pronounces the<br/>absolution.  Before giving absolution, the priest may assign to the<br/>penitent a psalm, prayer, or hymn to be said, or something to be done,<br/>as a sign of penitence and act of thanksgiving.</i></p>
<p><i>The content of a confession is not normally a matter of subsequent<br/>discussion.  The secrecy of a confession is morally absolute for the<br/>confessor, and must under no circumstances be broken.</i></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p><i>Concerning the Service</i></p>
<p><i>The death of a member of the Church should be reported as soon as<br/>possible to, and arrangements for the funeral should be made in<br/>consultation with, the Minister of the Congregation.</i></p>
<p><i>Baptized Christians are properly buried from the church.  The service<br/>should be held at a time when the congregation has opportunity to be<br/>present.</i></p>
<p><i>The coffin is to be closed before the service, and it remains closed<br/>thereafter.  It is appropriate that it be covered with a pall or other<br/>suitable covering.</i></p>
<p><i>If necessary, or if desired, all or part of the service of Committal<br/>may be said in the church.  If preferred, the Committal service may take<br/>place before the service in the church.  It may also be used prior to<br/>cremation.</i></p>
<p><i>A priest normally presides at the service.  It is appropriate that the<br/>bishop, when present, preside at the Eucharist and pronounce the<br/>Commendation.</i></p>
<p><i>It is desirable that the Lesson from the Old Testament, and the<br/>Epistle, be read by lay persons.</i></p>
<p><i>When the services of a priest cannot be obtained, a deacon or lay<br/>reader may preside at the service.</i></p>
<p><i>At the burial of a child, the passages from Lamentations, 1 John, and<br/><a href="bible:John+6">John 6</a>, together with <a href="bible:Psalm+23">Psalm 23</a>, are recommended.</i></p>
<p><i>It is customary that the celebrant meet the body and go before it into<br/>the church or towards the grave.</i></p>
<p><i>The anthems at the beginning of the service are sung or said as the<br/>body is borne into the church, or during the entrance of the ministers,<br/>or by the celebrant standing in the accustomed place.</i></p>]]>

<p><i>All stand while one or more of the following anthems is sung or said. A<br/>hymn, psalm, or some other suitable anthem may be sung instead.</i></p>
<p>I am Resurrection and I am Life, says the Lord.<br/>Whoever has faith in me shall have life,<br/>even though he die.<br/>And everyone who has life,<br/>and has committed himself to me in faith,<br/>shall not die for ever.</p>
<p>As for me, I know that my Redeemer lives<br/>and that at the last he will stand upon the earth.<br/>After my awaking, he will raise me up;<br/>and in my body I shall see God.<br/>I myself shall see, and my eyes behold him<br/>who is my friend and not a stranger.</p>
<p>For none of us has life in himself,<br/>and none becomes his own master when he dies.<br/>For if we have life, we are alive in the Lord,<br/>and if we die, we die in the Lord.<br/>So, then, whether we live or die,<br/>we are the Lord's possession.</p>]]>

<p>Lord Jesus Christ, by your death you took away thy sting of<br/>death:  Grant to us your servants so to follow in faith where<br/>you have led the way, that we may at length fall asleep<br/>peacefully in you ad wake up in your likeness; for your<br/>tender mercies' sake.  <i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>Father of all, we pray to you for those we love, but see no<br/>longer: Grant them your peace; let light perpetual shine upon<br/>them; and, in your loving wisdom and almighty power, work<br/>in them the good purpose of your perfect will; through Jesus<br/>Christ our Lord.  <i>Amen.</i></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<h1>An Order for Burial</h1>
<p><i>When, for pastoral considerations, neither of the burial rites in this<br/>Book is deemed appropriate, the following form is used.</i></p>
<p>1.  The body is received.  The celebrant may meet the body and conduct<br/>it into the church or chapel, or it may be in place before the<br/>congregation assembles.</p>
<p>2.  Anthems from Holy Scripture or psalms may be sung or said, or a<br/>hymn may be sung.</p>
<p>3.  Prayer may be offered for the bereaved.</p>
<p>4.  One or more passages of Holy Scripture are read.  Psalms, hymns,<br/>or anthems may follow the readings.  If there is to be a Communion, the<br/>last Reading is from the Gospel.</p>
<p>5.  A homily may follow the Readings, and the Apostles' Creed may be<br/>recited.</p>
<p>6.  Prayer, including the Lord's Prayer, is offered for the deceased,<br/>for those who mourn, and for the Christian community, remembering the<br/>promises of God in Christ about eternal life.</p>
<p>7.  The deceased is commended to God, and the body is committed to its<br/>resting place.  The committal may take place either where the preceding<br/>service has been held, or at the graveside.</p>
<p>8.  If there is a Communion, it precedes the commendation, and begins<br/>with the Peace and Offertory of the Eucharist.  Any of the authorized<br/>eucharistic prayers may be used.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<h1>Note:</h1>
<p><i>The liturgy for the dead is an Easter liturgy.  It finds all meaning in<br/>the resurrection.  Because Jesus was raised from the dead, we too, shall<br/>be raised.</i></p>
<p><i>The liturgy, therefore, is characterized by joy, in the certainty that<br/>"neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things<br/>present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor<br/>anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love<br/>of God in Christ Jesus our Lord."</i></p>
<p><i>This joy, however, does not make human grief unchristian.  The very<br/>love we have for each other in Christ brings deep sorrow when we are<br/>parted by death.  Jesus himself wept at the grave of his friend.  So,<br/>while we rejoice that one we love has entered into the nearer presence<br/>of our Lord, we sorrow in sympathy with those who mourn.</i></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<h1>Preface to the Ordination Rites</h1>
<p><i>The Holy Scriptures and ancient Christian writers make it clear that<br/>from the apostles' time, there have been different ministries within the<br/>Church.  In particular, since the time of the New Testament, three<br/>distinct orders of ordained ministers have been characteristic of<br/>Christ's holy Catholic Church.  First, there is the order of bishops who<br/>carry on the apostolic work of leading, supervising, and uniting the<br/>Church.  Secondly, associated with them are the presbyters, or ordained<br/>elders, in subsequent times generally known as priests. Together with<br/>the bishops, they take part in the governance of the Church, in the<br/>carrying out of its missionary and pastoral work, and in the preaching<br/>of the Word of God and administering his holy Sacraments.  Thirdly,<br/>there are deacons who assist bishops and priests in all of this work.<br/>It is also a special responsibility of deacons to minister in Christ's<br/>name to the poor, the sick, the suffering, and the helpless.</i></p>
<p><i>The persons who are chosen and recognized by the Church as being called<br/>by God to the ordained ministry are admitted to these sacred orders by<br/>solemn prayer and the laying on of episcopal hands.  It has been, and<br/>is, the intention and purpose of this Church to maintain and continue<br/>these three orders; and for this purpose these services of ordination<br/>and consecration are appointed.  No persons are allowed to exercise the<br/>offices of bishop, priest, or deacon in this Church unless they are so<br/>ordained, or have already received such ordination with the laying on of<br/>hands by bishops who are themselves duly qualified to confer Holy<br/>Orders.</i></p>
<p><i>It is also recognized and affirmed that the threefold ministry is not<br/>the exclusive property of this portion of Christ's catholic Church, but<br/>is a gift from God for the nurture of his people and the proclamation of<br/>his Gospel everywhere.  Accordingly, the manner of ordaining in this<br/>Church is to be such as has been, and is, most generally recognized by<br/>Christian people as suitable for the conferring of the sacred orders of<br/>bishops, priest, and deacon.</i></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p><i>Concerning the Ordination of a Bishop</i></p>
<p><i>In accordance with ancient custom, it is desirable, if possible, that<br/>bishops be ordained on Sundays and other feasts of our Lord or on the<br/>feasts of apostles or evangelists.</i></p>
<p><i>When a bishop is to be ordained, the Presiding Bishop of this Church,<br/>or a bishop appointed by the Presiding Bishop, presides and serves as<br/>chief consecrator.  At least two other bishops are co-consecrators.<br/>Representatives of the presbyterate, diaconate, and laity of the diocese<br/>for which the new bishop is to be consecrated, are assigned appropriate<br/>duties in the service.</i></p>
<p><i>From the beginning of the service until the Offertory, the chief<br/>consecrator presides from a chair placed close to the people, so that<br/>all may see and hear what is done.  The other bishops, or a convenient<br/>number of them, sit to the right and left of the chief consecrator.</i></p>
<p><i>The bishop-elect is vested in a rochet or alb, without stole, tippet,<br/>or other vesture distinctive of ecclesiastical or academic rank or<br/>order.</i></p>
<p><i>When the bishop-elect is presented, his full name (designated by the<br/>symbol <b><span class="person">N</span></b><b><span class="person">N</span></b>) is used.  Thereafter, it is appropriate to refer to him<br/>only by the Christian name by which he wishes to be known.</i></p>
<p><i>At the Offertory, it is appropriate that the bread and wine be brought<br/>to the Altar by the family or friends of the newly ordained.</i></p>
<p><i>The family of the newly ordained may receive Communion before other<br/>members of the congregation.  Opportunity is always given to the people<br/>to communicate.</i></p>

<p><i>The Presiding Bishop then directs that the testimonials of the election<br/>be read.</i></p>
<p><i>When the reading of the testimonials is ended, the Presiding Bishop<br/>requires the following promise from the Bishop-elect</i></p>
<p>In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy<br/>Spirit, I, <b><span class="person">N</span></b><b><span class="person">N</span></b>, chosen Bishop of the Church in <b><span class="person">N</span></b>, solemnly<br/>declare that I do believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old and<br/>New Testaments to be the Word of God, and to contain all<br/>things necessary to salvation; and I do solemnly engage to<br/>conform to the doctrine, discipline, and worship of the<br/>Episcopal Church.</p>
<p><i>The Bishop-elect then signs the above Declaration in the sight of all<br/>present.  The witnesses add their signatures.</i></p>

<p>You are called to guard the faith, unity, and discipline of the<br/>Church; to celebrate and to provide for the administration of<br/>the sacraments of the New Covenant; to ordain priests and<br/>deacons and to join in ordaining bishops; and to be in all<br/>things a faithful pastor and wholesome example for the<br/>entire flock of Christ.</p>
<p>With your fellow bishops you will share in the leadership of<br/>the Church throughout the world.  Your heritage is the faith<br/>of patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs, and those of<br/>every generation who have looked to God in hope.  Your joy<br/>will be to follow him who came, not to be served, but to<br/>serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.</p>

<![CDATA[<h1>The Examination</h1>
<p><i>All are seated except the ordinand, who stands before the Bishop.</i></p>
<p><i>The Bishop addresses the ordinand as follows</i></p>
<p>My <i>brother</i>, the Church is the family of God, the body of<br/>Christ, and the temple of the Holy Spirit.  All baptized people<br/>are called to make Christ known as Savior and Lord, and to<br/>share in the renewing of his world.  Now you are called to<br/>work as pastor, priest, and teacher, together with your<br/>bishop and fellow presbyters, and to take your share in the<br/>councils of the Church.</p>
<p>As a priest, it will be your task to proclaim by word and deed<br/>the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and to fashion your life in<br/>accordance with its precepts.  You are to love and serve the<br/>people among whom you work, caring alike for young and<br/>old, strong and weak, rich and poor. You are to preach, to<br/>declare God's forgiveness to penitent sinners, to pronounce<br/>God's blessing, to share in the administration of Holy<br/>Baptism and in the celebration of the mysteries of Christ's<br/>Body and Blood, and to perform the other ministrations<br/>entrusted to you.</p>
<p>In all that you do, you are to nourish Christ's people from the<br/>riches of his grace, and strengthen them to glorify God in this<br/>life and in the life to come.</p>
<p>My <i>brother</i>, do you believe that you are truly called by God<br/>and his Church to this priesthood?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>  I believe I am so called.</p>
<p><i>Bishop</i>  Do you now in the presence of the Church commit<br/>yourself to this trust and responsibility?</p>

<p>My <i>brother</i>, every Christian is called to follow Jesus Christ,<br/>serving God the Father, through the power of the Holy Spirit.<br/>God now calls you to a special ministry of servanthood<br/>directly under your bishop.

<p>As a deacon in the Church, you are to study the Holy<br/>Scriptures, to seek nourishment from them, and to model<br/>your life upon them.  You are to make Christ and his<br/>redemptive love known, by your word and example, to those<br/>among whom you live, and work, and worship.  You are to<br/>interpret to the Church the needs, concerns, and hopes of the<br/>world.  You are to assist the bishop and priests in public<br/>worship and in the ministration of God's Word and<br/>Sacraments, and you are to carry out other duties assigned to<br/>you from time to time.  At all times, your life and teaching are<br/>to show Christ's people that in serving the helpless they are<br/>serving Christ himself.</p>
<p>My <i>brother</i>, do you believe that you are truly called by God<br/>and his Church to the life and work of a deacon?</p>

<p><i>Bishop</i>  Do you now in the presence of the Church commit<br/>yourself to this trust and responsibility?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>  I do.</p>

<p>O God, most merciful Father, we praise you for sending your<br/>Son Jesus Christ, who took on himself the form of a servant,<br/>and humbled himself, becoming obedient even to death on<br/>the cross.  We praise you that you have highly exalted him,<br/>and made him Lord of all; and that, through him, we know<br/>that whoever would be great must be servant of all.  We praise<br/>you for the many ministries in your Church, and for calling<br/>this your servant to the order of deacons.</p>

<p><i>The Bishop continues</i></p>
<p>Make <i>him</i>, O Lord, modest and humble, strong and constant,<br/>to observe the discipline of Christ.  Let <i>his</i> life and teaching so<br/>reflect your commandments, that through <i>him</i> many may<br/>come to know you and love you.  As your Son came not to be<br/>served but to serve, may this deacon share in Christ's service,<br/>and come to the unending glory of him who, with you and<br/>the Holy Spirit, lives and reigns, one God, for ever and ever.</p>
<p><i>The People in a loud voice respond</i>  Amen.</p>

<p><i>The chief minister is normally the bishop; but, if necessary, a deputy<br/>may be appointed.  The bishop, when present, is the chief celebrant of<br/>the Eucharist.  In the bishop's absence, a priest being inducted is the<br/>chief celebrant.</i></p>
<p><i>Other priests, if any, who serve in the same congregation also stand<br/>with the chief celebrant at the Altar, and deacons assist according to<br/>their order.</i></p>
<p><i>Lay persons from the congregation read the Old Testament Lesson and the<br/>Epistle, and perform other actions as indicated in the rubrics.  A<br/>deacon or priest reads the Gospel.  Other clergy of the diocese<br/>participate in this celebration as an expression of the collegiality of<br/>the ministry in which they share.</i></p>
<p><i>Ministers of other Churches may appropriately be invited to<br/>participate.</i></p>
<p><i>The new minister, if a deacon, should read the Gospel, prepare the<br/>elements at the Offertory, assist the celebration at the Altar, and<br/>dismiss the congregation.</i></p>

<p>Through the ages, Almighty God has moved his people to<br/>build houses of prayer and praise, and to set apart places for<br/>the ministry of his holy Word and Sacraments.  With gratitude<br/>for the building (rebuilding, <i>or</i> adornment) of (<i>name of<br/>church</i>), we are now gathered to dedicate and consecrate<br/>it in God's Name.</p>

<p><i>When the clergy and people assemble before the service, they may gather<br/>out of doors, in the parish house, in a former or neighboring place of<br/>worship, or in some other building.  When convenient, the procession may<br/>go around the building(s) to be dedicated and then go to the principal<br/>door.  Hymns or psalms may be used in procession. The use of portable<br/>musical instruments is suitable.  If there is an organ, it is<br/>appropriate that it remain silent until dedicated.  When the weather is<br/>inclement, or other circumstances make it necessary, the congregation<br/>may assemble inside the church; but the bishop, other clergy, and<br/>attendants will enter in procession through the principal door.</i></p>

<p><i>At the dedication of the lectern, the Bible is brought forward and put<br/>into place by a donor, or a lay reader, or another suitable person.</i></p>
<p><i>If there is an address instead of a sermon, it is suitable that a<br/>warden or other lay person outline the plans of the congregation for<br/>witness to the Gospel.  The bishop may respond, indicating the place of<br/>this congregation within the life of the Diocese.</i></p>

<![CDATA[<h1>Concerning the Catechism</h1>
<p><i>This catechism is primarily intended for use by parish priests,<br/>deacons, and lay catechists, to give an outline for instruction.  It is<br/>a commentary on the creeds, but is not meant to be a complete statement<br/>of belief and practices; rather, it is a point of departure for the<br/>teacher, and it is cast in the traditional question and answer form for<br/>ease of reference.</i></p>
<p><i>The second use of this catechism is to provide a brief summary of the<br/>Church's teaching for an inquiring stranger who picks up a Prayer Book.</i></p>
<p><i>It may also be used to form a simple service; since the matter is<br/>arranged under headings, it is suitable for selective use, and the<br/>leader may introduce prayers and hymns as needed.</i></p>]]>

<p><b><span class="person">A</span></b> From the beginning, human beings have misused their freedom and<br/>made wrong choices.</p>
<p><b><span class="person">Q</span></b> Why do we not use our freedom as we should?</p>

<![CDATA[<h1>Definition of the Union of the Divine<br/>and Human Natures in the Person of Christ</h1>
<p><i>Council of Chalcedon, 451 A.D., Act V</i></p>
<p>Therefore, following the holy fathers, we all with one accord teach men<br/>to acknowledge one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, at once<br/>complete in Godhead and complete in manhood, truly God and truly man,<br/>consisting also of a reasonable soul and body; of one substance<br/>(homoousios) with the Father as regards his Godhead, and at the same<br/>time of one substance with us as regards his manhood; like us in all<br/>respects, apart from sin; as regards his Godhead, begotten of the Father<br/>before the ages, but yet as regards his manhood begotten, for us men and<br/>for our salvation, of Mary the Virgin, the God-bearer (Theotokos); one<br/>and the same Christ, Son, Lord, Only-begotten, recognized in two<br/>natures, without confusion, without change, without division, without<br/>separation; the distinction of natures being in no way annulled by the<br/>union, but rather the characteristics of each nature being preserved and<br/>coming together to form one person and subsistence, not as parted or<br/>separated into two persons, but one and the same Son and Only-begotten<br/>God the Word, Lord Jesus Christ; even as the prophets from earliest<br/>times spoke of him, and our Lord Jesus Christ himself taught us, and the<br/>creed of the Fathers has handed down to us.</p>
<h1>Quicunque Vult</h1>
<p><i>commonly called</i></p>
<h1>The Creed of Saint Athanasius</h1>
<p>Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he  hold<br/>the Catholic Faith.</p>
<p>Which Faith except everyone do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt<br/>he shall perish everlastingly.</p>
<p>And the Catholic Faith is this: That we worship one God in Trinity,  and<br/>Trinity in Unity, neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing  the<br/>Substance.</p>
<p>For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, and another<br/>of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is<br/>all one, the Glory equal, the Majesty co-eternal.</p>
<p>Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>The Father uncreate, the Son uncreate, and the Holy Ghost uncreate.</p>
<p>The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible, and the Holy<br/>Ghost incomprehensible.</p>
<p>The Father eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy Ghost eternal.</p>
<p>And yet they are not three eternals, but one eternal.</p>
<p>As also there are not three incomprehensibles, nor three uncreated,  but<br/>one uncreated, and one incomprehensible.</p>
<p>So likewise the Father is Almighty, the Son Almighty, and the Holy<br/>Ghost Almighty.</p>
<p>And yet they are not three Almighties, but one Almighty.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>So the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God.</p>
<p>And yet they are not three Gods, but one God.</p>
<p>So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, and the Holy Ghost Lord.</p>
<p>And yet not three Lords, but one Lord.</p>
<p>For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge<br/>every Person by himself to be both God and Lord,</p>
<p>So are we forbidden by the Catholic Religion, to say, There be three<br/>Gods, or three Lords.</p>
<p>The Father is made of none, neither created, nor begotten.</p>
<p>The Son is of the Father alone, not made, nor created, but begotten.</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost is of the Father and of the Son, neither made, nor<br/>created, nor begotten, but proceeding.</p>
<p>So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons;  one<br/>Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts.</p>
<p>And in this Trinity none is afore, or after other; none is greater, or<br/>less than another;</p>
<p>But the whole three Persons are co-eternal together and co-equal.</p>
<p>So that in all things, as is aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity and the<br/>Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped.</p>
<p>He therefore that will be saved must thus think of the Trinity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation that he also<br/>believe rightly the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>For the right Faith is, that we believe and confess, that our Lord<br/>Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man;</p>
<p>God, of the substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds; and<br/>Man of the substance of his Mother, born in the world;</p>
<p>Perfect God and perfect Man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh<br/>subsisting.</p>
<p>Equal to the Father, as touching his Godhead; and inferior to the<br/>Father, as touching his manhood;</p>
<p>Who, although he be God and Man, yet he is not two, but one Christ;</p>
<p>One, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh but by taking of the<br/>Manhood into God;</p>
<p>One altogether; not by confusion of Substance, but by unity of  Person.</p>
<p>For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man, so God and Man is one<br/>Christ;</p>
<p>Who suffered for our salvation, descended into hell, rose again the<br/>third day from the dead.</p>
<p>He ascended into heaven, he sitteth at the right hand of the Father,<br/>God Almighty, from whence he will come to judge the quick and the  dead.</p>
<p>At whose coming all men will rise again with their bodies and shall<br/>give account for their own works.</p>
<p>And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting; and they<br/>that have done evil into everlasting fire.</p>
<p>This is the Catholic Faith, which except a man believe faithfully, he<br/>cannot be saved.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<h1>Preface</h1>
<h1>The First Book of Common Prayer (1549)</h1>
<p>There was never any thing by the wit of man so well devised, or so sure<br/>established, which in continuance of time hath not been corrupted: as,<br/>among other things, it may plainly appear by the common prayers in the<br/>Church, commonly called Divine Service: the first original and ground<br/>whereof, if a man would search out by the ancient fathers, he shall<br/>find, that the same was not ordained, but of a good purpose, and for a<br/>great advancement of godliness: For they so ordered the matter, that all<br/>the whole Bible (or the greatest part thereof) should be read over once<br/>in the year, intending thereby, that the Clergy, and especially such as<br/>were Ministers of the congregation, should (by often reading, and<br/>meditation of God's word) be stirred up to godliness themselves, and be<br/>more able to exhort others by wholesome doctrine, and to confute them<br/>that were adversaries to the truth.  And further, that the people (by<br/>daily hearing of holy Scripture read in the Church) should continually<br/>profit more and more in the knowledge of God, and be the more inflamed<br/>with the love of his true religion.</p>
<p>But these many years passed, this godly and decent order of the ancient<br/>fathers hath been so altered, broken, and neglected, by planting in<br/>uncertain stories, Legends, Responds, Verses, vain repetitions,<br/>Commemorations, and Synodals, that commonly when any book of the Bible<br/>was begun, before three or four Chapters were read out, all the rest<br/>were unread.  And in this sort the book of Isaiah was begun in Advent,<br/>and the book of Genesis in Septuagesima; but they were only begun, and<br/>never read through.  After a like sort were other books of holy<br/>Scripture used.  And moreover, whereas St. Paul would have such language<br/>spoken to the people in the Church, as they might understand, and have<br/>profit by hearing the same, the Service in the Church of England (these<br/>many years) hath been read in Latin to the people, which they understood<br/>not; so that they have heard with their ears only; and their hearts,<br/>spirit, and mind, have not been edified thereby.  And furthermore,<br/>notwithstanding that the ancient fathers had divided the Psalms into<br/>seven portions, whereof every one was called a nocturn, now of late time<br/>a few of them have been daily said (and oft repeated), and the rest<br/>utterly omitted.  Moreover, the number and hardness of the Rules called<br/>the Pie, and the manifold changings of the service, was the cause, that<br/>to turn the Book only, was so hard and intricate a matter, that many<br/>times, there was more business to find out what should be read, than to<br/>read it when it was found out.</p>
<p>These inconveniences therefore considered, here is set forth such an<br/>order, whereby the same shall be redressed.  And for a readiness in this<br/>matter, here is drawn out a Kalendar for that purpose, which is plain<br/>and easy to be understood, wherein (so much as may be) the reading of<br/>holy Scripture is so set forth, that all things shall be done in order,<br/>without breaking one piece thereof from another.  For this cause be cut<br/>off Anthems, Responds, Invitatories, and such like things, as did break<br/>the continual course of the reading of the Scripture.</p>
<p>Yet because there is no remedy, but that of necessity there must be some<br/>rules: therefore certain rules are here set forth, which, as they be few<br/>in number; so they be plain and easy to be understood.  So that here you<br/>have an order for prayer (as touching the reading of the holy<br/>Scripture), much agreeable to the mind and purpose of the old fathers,<br/>and a great deal more profitable and commodious, than that which of late<br/>was used.  It is more profitable, because here are left out many things,<br/>whereof some be untrue, some uncertain, same vain</p>]]>

It is<br/>also more commodious, both for the shortness thereof, and for the<br/>plainness of the order, and for that the rules be few and easy.<br/>Furthermore, by this order the curates shall need none other books for<br/>their public service, but this book and the Bible: by the means whereof,<br/>the people shall not be at so great charge for books, as in time past<br/>they have been.</p>
<p>And where heretofore, there hath been great diversity in saying and<br/>singing in churches within this realm: some following Salisbury use,<br/>some Hereford use, some the use of Bangor, some of York, and some of<br/>Lincoln: now from henceforth, all the whole realm shall have but one<br/>use.  And if any would judge this way more painful, because that all<br/>things must be read upon the book, whereas before, by reason of so often<br/>repetition, they could say many things by heart: if those men will weigh<br/>their labor with the profit in knowledge, which daily they shall obtain<br/>by reading upon the book, they will not refuse the pain, in<br/>consideration of the great profit that shall ensue thereof.</p>
<p>And forasmuch as nothing else, almost, be so plainly set forth, but<br/>doubts may arise in the use and practicing of the same: to appease all<br/>such diversity (if any arise), and for the resolution of all doubts,<br/>concerning the manner how to understand, do, and execute, the things<br/>contained in this book: the parties that so doubt, or diversely take any<br/>thing, shall always resort to the Bishop of the Diocese, who by his<br/>discretion shall take order for the quieting and appeasing of the same;<br/>so that the same order be not contrary to any thing contained in this<br/>book.</p>
<p>Though it be appointed in the afore written preface, that all things<br/>shall be read and sung in the church in the English tongue, to the end<br/>that the congregation may be thereby edified: yet it is not meant, but<br/>when men say Matins and Evensong privately, they may say the same in any<br/>language that they themselves do understand.  Neither that any man shall<br/>be bound to the saying of them, but such as from time to time, in<br/>Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, parish Churches, and Chapels to the<br/>same annexed, shall serve the congregation.</p>

<![CDATA[<h1>II.  Of the Word or Son of God, which was made very Man.</h1>
<p>The Son, which is the Word of the Father, begotten from everlasting of<br/>the Father, the very and eternal God, and of one substance with the<br/>Father, took Man's nature in the womb of the blessed Virgin, of her<br/>substance: so that two whole and perfect Natures, that is to say, the<br/>Godhead and Manhood, were joined together in one Person, never to be<br/>divided, whereof is one Christ, very God, and very Man; who truly<br/>suffered, was crucified, dead, and buried, to reconcile his Father to<br/>us, and to be a sacrifice, not only for original guilt, but also for<br/>actual sins of men.</p>
<h1>III.  Of the going down of Christ into Hell.</h1>
<p>As Christ died for us, and was buried; so also it is to be believed,<br/>that he went down into Hell.</p>
<h1>IV.  Of the Resurrection of Christ.</h1>
<p>Christ did truly rise again from death, and took again his body, with<br/>flesh, bones, and all things appertaining to the perfection of Man's<br/>nature; wherewith he ascended into Heaven, and there sitteth, until he<br/>return to judge all Men at the last day.</p>
<h1>V.  Of the Holy Ghost.</h1>
<p>The Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the Son, is of one<br/>substance, majesty, and glory, with the Father and the Son, very and<br/>eternal God.</p>
<h1>VI.  Of the Sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures for Salvation.</h1>
<p>Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that<br/>whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be<br/>required of any man, that it should be believed as an article of the<br/>Faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation.  In the name<br/>of the Holy Scripture we do understand those canonical Books of the Old<br/>and New Testament, of whose authority was never any doubt in the Church.</p>

<p>The First Book of Maccabees,</p>
<p>The Second Book of Maccabees.</p>
<p>All the Books of the New Testament, as they are commonly received, we<br/>do receive, and account them Canonical.</p>
<h1>VII.  Of the Old Testament.</h1>
<p>The Old Testament is not contrary to the New: for both in the Old and<br/>New Testament everlasting life is offered to Mankind by Christ, who is<br/>the only Mediator between God and Man, being both God and Man.<br/>Wherefore they are not to be heard, which feign that the old Fathers did<br/>look only for transitory promises.  Although the Law given from God by<br/>Moses, as touching Ceremonies and Rites, do not bind Christian men, nor<br/>the Civil precepts thereof ought of necessity to be received in any<br/>commonwealth; yet notwithstanding, no Christian man whatsoever is free<br/>from the obedience of the Commandments which are called Moral.</p>
<h1>VIII.  Of the Creeds.</h1>
<p>The Nicene Creed, and that which is commonly called the Apostles' Creed,<br/>ought thoroughly to be received and believed: for they may be proved by<br/>most certain warrants of Holy Scripture.</p>
<p>The original Article given Royal assent in 1571 and reaffirmed in 1662,<br/>was entitled, "Of the Three Creeds; and began as follows, "The Three<br/>Creeds, Nicene Creed, Athanasius's Creed, and that which is commonly<br/>called the Apostles' Creed..."</p>
<h1>IX.  Of Original or Birth Sin.</h1>
<p>Original sin standeth not in the following of Adam, (as the Pelagians do<br/>vainly talk;) but it is the fault and corruption of the Nature of every<br/>man, that naturally is engendered of the offspring of Adam; whereby man<br/>is very far gone from original righteousness, and is of his own nature<br/>inclined to evil, so that the flesh lusteth always contrary to the<br/>Spirit; and therefore in every person born into this world, it deserveth<br/>God's wrath and damnation.  And this infection of nature doth remain,<br/>yea in them that are regenerated; whereby the lust of the flesh, called<br/>in Greek, <i>fro/nhma sarko/s</i>, (which some do expound the wisdom, some<br/>sensuality, some the affection, some the desire, of the flesh), is not<br/>subject to the Law of God.  And although there is no condemnation for<br/>them that believe and are baptized; yet the Apostle doth confess, that<br/>concupiscence and lust hath of itself the nature of sin.</p>
<h1>X.  Of Free Will.</h1>
<p>The condition of Man after the fall of Adam is such, that he cannot turn<br/>and prepare himself, by his own natural strength and good works, to<br/>faith, and calling upon God.  Wherefore we have no power to do good<br/>works pleasant and acceptable to God, without the grace of God by Christ<br/>preventing us, that we may have a good will, and working with us, when<br/>we have that good will.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<h1>XI.  Of the Justification of Man.</h1>
<p>We are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord<br/>and Saviour Jesus Christ by Faith, and not for our own works or<br/>deservings.  Wherefore, that we are justified by Faith only, is a most<br/>wholesome Doctrine, and very full of comfort, as more largely expressed<br/>in the Homily of Justification.</p>
<h1>XII.  Of Good Works.</h1>
<p>Albeit that Good Works, which are the fruits of Faith, and follow after<br/>Justification, cannot put away our sins, and endure the severity of<br/>God's judgment; yet are they pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ,<br/>and do spring out necessarily of a true and lively Faith; insomuch that<br/>by them a lively Faith may be as evidently known as a tree discerned by<br/>the fruit.</p>
<h1>XIII.  Of Works before Justification.</h1>
<p>Works done before the grace of Christ, and the Inspiration of the<br/>Spirit, are not pleasant to God, forasmuch as they spring not of faith<br/>in Jesus Christ; neither do they make men meet to receive grace, or (as<br/>the School-authors say) deserve grace of congruity: yea rather, for that<br/>they are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done, we<br/>doubt not but they have the nature of sin.</p>
<h1>XIV.  Of Works of Supererogation.</h1>
<p>Voluntary Works besides, over and above, God's Commandments, which they<br/>call Works of Supererogation, cannot be taught without arrogancy and<br/>impiety: for by them men do declare, that they not only render unto God<br/>as much as they are bound to, but that they do more for his sake, than<br/>of bounden duty is required: whereas Christ saith plainly, When ye have<br/>done all that are commanded to you, say, We are unprofitable servants.</p>
<h1>XV.  Of Christ alone without Sin.</h1>
<p>Christ in the truth of our nature was made like unto us in all things,<br/>sin only except, from which he was clearly void, both in his flesh, and<br/>in his spirit.  He came to be the Lamb without spot, who, by sacrifice<br/>of himself once made, should take away the sins of the world; and sin<br/>(as Saint John saith) was not in him.  But all we the rest, although<br/>baptized, and born again in Christ, yet offend in many things; and if we<br/>say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.</p>
<h1>XVI.  Of Sin after Baptism.</h1>
<p>Not every deadly sin willingly committed after Baptism is sin against<br/>the Holy Ghost, and unpardonable.  Wherefore the grant of repentance is<br/>not be denied to such as fall into sin after Baptism.  After we have<br/>received the Holy Ghost, we may depart from grace given, and fall into<br/>sin, and by the grace of God we may arise again, and amend our lives.<br/>And therefore they are to be condemned, which say, they can no more sin<br/>as long as they live here, or deny the place of forgiveness to such as<br/>truly repent.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<h1>XVII.  Of Predestination and Election</h1>
<p>Predestination to Life is the everlasting purpose of God, whereby<br/>(before the foundations of the world were laid) he hath constantly<br/>decreed by his counsel secret to us, to deliver from curse and damnation<br/>those whom he hath chosen in Christ out of mankind, and to bring them by<br/>Christ to everlasting salvation, as vessels made to honour.  Wherefore,<br/>they which be endued with so excellent a benefit of God, be called<br/>according to God's purpose by his Spirit working in due season: they<br/>through Grace obey the calling: they be justified freely: they be made<br/>sons of God by adoption: they be made like the image of his only-<br/>begotten Son Jesus Christ: they walk religiously in good works, and at<br/>length, by God's mercy, they attain to everlasting felicity.</p>
<p>As the godly consideration of Predestination, and our Election in<br/>Christ, is full of sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable comfort to godly<br/>persons, and such as feel in themselves the working of the Spirit of<br/>Christ, mortifying the works of the flesh, and their earthly members,<br/>and drawing up their mind to high and heavenly things, as well because<br/>it doth greatly establish and confirm their faith of eternal Salvation<br/>to be enjoyed through Christ, as because it doth fervently kindle their<br/>love towards God: So, for curious and carnal persons, lacking the Spirit<br/>of Christ, to have continually before their eyes the sentence of God's<br/>Predestination, is a most dangerous downfall, whereby the Devil doth<br/>thrust them either into desperation, or into wrethchlessness of most<br/>unclean living, no less perilous than desperation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we must receive God's promises in such wise, as they be<br/>generally set forth to us in Holy Scripture: and, in our doings, that<br/>Will of God is to be followed, which we have expressly declared unto us<br/>in the word of God.</p>
<h1>XVIII.  Of obtaining eternal Salvation only by the Name of Christ</h1>
<p>They also are to be had accursed that presume to say, That every man<br/>shall be saved by the Law or Sect which he professeth, so that he be<br/>diligent to frame his life according to that Law, and the light of<br/>Nature.  For Holy Scripture doth set out unto us only the Name of Jesus<br/>Christ, whereby men must be saved.</p>
<h1>XIX.  Of the Church.</h1>
<p>The visible Church of Christ is a congregation of faithful men, in which<br/>the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be duly ministered<br/>according to Christ's ordinance, in all those things that of necessity<br/>are requisite to the same.</p>
<p>As the Church of Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch, have erred; so also<br/>the Church of Rome hath erred, not only in their living and manner of<br/>Ceremonies, but also in matters of Faith.</p>
<h1>XX.  Of the Authority of the Church.</h1>
<p>The Church hath power to decree Rites or Ceremonies, and authority in<br/>Controversies of Faith: and yet it is not lawful for the Church to<br/>ordain anything that is contrary to God's Word written, neither may it<br/>so expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another.<br/>Wherefore, although the Church be a witness and a keeper of Holy Writ,<br/>yet, as it ought not to decree any thing against the same, so besides<br/>the same ought not to enforce any thing to be believed for necessity of<br/>Salvation.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<h1>XXI.  Of the Authority of General Councils.</h1>
<p>[The Twenty-first of the former Articles is omitted; because it is<br/>partly of a local and civil nature, and is provided for, as to the<br/>remaining parts of it, in other Articles.]</p>
<p><i>The original 1571, 1662 text of this Article, omitted in the version of<br/>1801, reads as follows: "General Councils may not be gathered together<br/>without the commandment and will of Princes.  And when they be gathered<br/>together, (forasmuch as they be an assembly of men, whereof all be not<br/>governed with the Spirit and Word of God,) they may err, and sometimes<br/>have erred, even in things pertaining unto God.  Wherefore things<br/>ordained by them as necessary to salvation have neither strength nor<br/>authority, unless it may be declared that they be taken out of holy<br/>Scripture."</i></p>
<h1>XXII.  Of Purgatory.</h1>
<p>The Romish Doctrine concerning Purgatory, Pardons, Worshipping and<br/>Adoration, as well of Images as of Relics, and also Invocation of<br/>Saints, is a fond thing, vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty<br/>of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God.</p>
<h1>XXIII.  Of Ministering in the Congregation</h1>
<p>It is not lawful for any man to take upon him the office of public<br/>preaching, or ministering the Sacraments in the Congregation, before he<br/>be lawfully called, and sent to execute the same.  And those we ought to<br/>judge lawfully called and sent, which be chosen and called to this work<br/>by men who have public authority given unto them in the Congregation, to<br/>call and send Ministers into the Lord's vineyard.</p>
<h1>XXIV.  Of Speaking in the Congregation in such a Tongue as the people<br/>understandeth.</h1>
<p>It is a thing plainly repugnant to the Word of God, and the custom of<br/>the Primitive Church, to have public Prayer in the Church, or to<br/>minister the Sacraments, in a tongue not understanded of the people.</p>
<h1>XXV.  Of the Sacraments.</h1>
<p>Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of Christian<br/>men's profession, but rather they be certain sure witnesses, and<br/>effectual signs of grace, and God's good will towards us, by the which<br/>he doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also<br/>strengthen and confirm our Faith in him.</p>
<p>There are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel, that<br/>is to say, Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord.</p>
<p>Those five commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation,<br/>Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and Extreme Unction, are not to be counted<br/>for Sacraments of the Gospel, being such as have grown partly of the<br/>corrupt following of the Apostles, partly are states of life allowed in<br/>the Scriptures; but yet have not like nature of Sacraments with Baptism,<br/>and the Lord's Supper, for that they have not any visible sign or<br/>ceremony ordained of God.</p>
<p>The Sacraments are not ordained of Christ to be gazed upon, or to be<br/>carried about, but that we should duly use them.  And in such only as<br/>worthily receive the same, they have a wholesome effect or operation:but<br/>they that receive them unworthily, purchase to themselves damnation, as<br/>Saint Paul saith.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<h1>XXVI.  Of the Unworthiness of the Ministers, which hinders not the<br/>effect of the Sacraments.</h1>
<p>Although in the visible Church the evil be ever mingled with the good,<br/>and sometimes the evil have chief authority in the Ministration of the<br/>Word and Sacraments, yet forasmuch as they do not the same in their own<br/>name, but in Christ's, and do minister by his commission and authority,<br/>we may use their Ministry, both in hearing the Word of God, and in<br/>receiving the Sacraments.  Neither is the effect of Christ's ordinance<br/>taken away by their wickedness, nor the grace of God's gifts diminished<br/>from such as by faith, and rightly, do receive the Sacraments ministered<br/>unto them; which be effectual, because of Christ's institution and<br/>promise, although they be ministered by evil men.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it appertaineth to the discipline of the Church, that<br/>inquiry be made of evil Ministers, and that they be accused by those<br/>that have knowledge of their offences; and finally, being found guilty,<br/>by just judgment be deposed.</p>
<h1>XVII.  Of Baptism</h1>
<p>Baptism is not only a sign of profession, and mark of difference,<br/>whereby Christian men are discerned from others that be not christened,<br/>but it is also a sign of Regeneration or New-Birth, whereby, as by an<br/>instrument, they that receive Baptism rightly are grafted into the<br/>Church; the promises of the forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to<br/>be the sons of God by the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed;<br/>Faith is confirmed, and Grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.</p>
<p>The Baptism of young Children is in any wise to be retained in the<br/>Church, as most agreeable with the institution of Christ.</p>
<h1>XVIII.  Of the Lord's Supper.</h1>
<p>The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of the love that Christians<br/>ought to have among themselves one to another; but rather it is a<br/>Sacrament of our Redemption by Christ's death: insomuch that to such as<br/>rightly, worthily, and with faith, receive the same, the Bread which we<br/>break is a partaking of the Body of Christ; and likewise the Cup of<br/>Blessing is a partaking of the Blood of Christ.</p>
<p>Transubstantiation (or the change of the substance of Bread and Wine) in<br/>the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant<br/>to the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament,<br/>and hath given occasion to many superstitions.</p>
<p>The Body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten, in the Supper, only after<br/>an heavenly and spiritual manner.  And the mean whereby the Body of<br/>Christ is received and eaten in the Supper, is Faith.</p>
<p>The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was not by Christ's ordinance<br/>reserved, carried about, lifted up, or worshipped.</p>
<h1>XXIX.  Of the Wicked, which eat not the Body of Christ in the use of<br/>the Lord's Supper.</h1>
<p>The Wicked, and such as be void of a lively faith, although they<br/>docarnally and visibly press with their teeth (as Saint Augustine saith)<br/>the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ; yet in no wise are they<br/>partakers of Christ: but rather, to their condemnation, do eat and drink<br/>the sign or Sacrament of so great a thing.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<h1>XXX.  Of both Kinds.</h1>
<p>The Cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the Lay-people: for both the<br/>parts of the Lord's Sacrament, by Christ's ordinance and commandment,<br/>ought to be ministered to all Christian men alike.</p>
<h1>XXXI.  Of the one Oblation of Christ finished upon the Cross.</h1>
<p>The Offering of Christ once made in that perfect redemption,<br/>propitiation, and satisfaction, for all the sins of the whole world,<br/>both original and actual; and there is none other satisfaction for sin,<br/>but that alone.  Wherefore the sacrifices of Masses, in the which it was<br/>commonly said, that the Priest did offer Christ for the quick and the<br/>dead, to have remission of pain or guilt, were blasphemous fables, and<br/>dangerous deceits.</p>
<h1>XXXII.  Of the Marriage of Priests.</h1>
<p>Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, are not commanded by God's Law, either to<br/>vow the estate of single life, or to abstain from marriage: therefore it<br/>is lawful for them, as for all other Christian men, to marry at their<br/>own discretion, as they shall judge the same to serve better to<br/>godliness.</p>
<h1>XXXIII.  Of excommunicate Persons, how they are to be avoided.</h1>
<p>That person which by open denunciation of the Church is rightly cut off<br/>from the unity of the Church, and excommunicated, ought to be taken of<br/>the whole multitude of the faithful, as an Heathen and Publican, until<br/>he be openly reconciled by penance, and received into the Church by a<br/>Judge that hath the authority thereunto.</p>
<h1>XXXIV.  Of the Traditions of the Church.</h1>
<p>It is not necessary that the Traditions and Ceremonies be in all places<br/>one, or utterly like; for at all times they have been divers, and may be<br/>changed according to the diversity of countries, times, and men's<br/>manners, so that nothing be ordained against God's Word.  Whosoever,<br/>through his private judgment, willingly and purposely, doth openly break<br/>the Traditions and Ceremonies of the Church, which be not repugnant to<br/>the Word of God, and be ordained and approved by common authority, ought<br/>to be rebuked openly, (that others may fear to do the like,) as he that<br/>offendeth against the common order of the Church, and hurteth the<br/>authority of the Magistrate, and woundeth the consciences of the weak<br/>brethren.</p>
<p>Every particular or national Church hath authority to ordain, change,<br/>and abolish, Ceremonies or Rites of the Church ordained only by man's<br/>authority, so that all things be done to edifying.</p>
<h1>XXXV.  Of the Homilies.</h1>
<p>The Second Book of Homilies, the several titles whereof we have joined<br/>under this Article, doth contain a godly and wholesome Doctrine, and<br/>necessary for these times, as doth the former Book of Homilies, which<br/>were set forth in the time of Edward the Sixth; and therefore we judge<br/>them to be read in Churches by the Ministers, diligently and distinctly,<br/>that they may be understanded of the people.</p>]]>

<p>[This Article is received in this Church, so far as it declares the Book<br/>of Homilies to be an explication of Christian doctrine, and instructive<br/>in piety and morals.  But all references to the constitution and laws of<br/>England are considered as inapplicable to the circumstances of this<br/>Church; which also suspends the order for the reading of said Homilies<br/>in churches, until a revision of them may be conveniently made, for the<br/>clearing of them, as well from obsolete words and phrases, as from the<br/>local references.]</p>
<h1>XXXVI.  Of Consecration of Bishops and Ministers.</h1>
<p>The Book of Consecration of Bishops, and Ordering of Priests and<br/>Deacons, as set forth by the General Convention of this Church in 1792,<br/>doth contain all things necessary to such Consecration and Ordering;<br/>neither hath it any thing that, of itself, is superstitious and ungodly.<br/>And, therefore, whosoever are consecrated or ordered according to said<br/>Form, we decree all such to be rightly, orderly, and lawfully<br/>consecrated and ordered.</p>
<p><i>The original 1571, 1662 text of this Article reads as follows: "The<br/>Book of Consecration of Archbishops and Bishops, and Ordering of Priests<br/>and Deacons, lately set forth in the time of Edward the Sixth, and<br/>confirmed at the same time by authority of Parliament, doth contain all<br/>things necessary to such Consecration and Ordering; neither hath it any<br/>thing, that of itself is superstitious and ungodly.  And therefore<br/>whosoever are consecrated or ordered according to the Rites of that<br/>Book, since the second year of the forenamed King Edwand unto this time,<br/>or hereafter shall be consecrated or ordered according to the same<br/>Rites; we decree all such to be rightly, orderly, and lawfully<br/>consecrated and ordered."</i></p>
<h1>XXXVII.  Of the Power of the Civil Magistrates.</h1>
<p>The Power of the Civil Magistrate extendeth to all men, as well Clergy<br/>as Laity, in all things temporal; but hath no authority in things purely<br/>spiritual.  And we hold it to be the duty of all men who are professors<br/>of the Gospel, to pay respectful obedience to the Civil Authority,<br/>regularly and legitimately constituted.</p>
<p><i>The original 1571, 1662 text of this Article reads as follows: "The<br/>King's Majesty hath the chief power in this Realm of England, and other<br/>his Dominions, unto whom the chief Government of all Estates of this<br/>Realm, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Civil, in all causes doth<br/>appertain, and is not, nor ought to be, subject to any foreign<br/>Jurisdiction.

<h1>XXXVIII.  Of Christian Men's Goods, which are not common.</h1>
<p>The Riches and Goods of Christians are not common, as touching the<br/>right, title, and possession of the same; as certain Anabaptists do<br/>falsely boast.  Notwithstanding, every man ought, of such things as he<br/>possesseth, liberally to give alms to the poor, according to his<br/>ability.</p>
<h1>XXXIX.  Of a Christian Man's Oath.</h1>
<p>As we confess that vain and rash Swearing is forbidden Christian men by<br/>our Lord Jesus Christ, and James his Apostle, so we judge, that<br/>Christian Religion doth not prohibit, but that a man may swear when the<br/>Magistrate requireth, in a cause of faith and charity, so it be done<br/>according to the Prophet's teaching in justice, judgment, and truth.</p>
<h1>The Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral 1886, 1888</h1>
<p><i>Adopted by the House of Bishops<br/>Chicago, 1886</i></p>
<p>We, Bishops of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of<br/>America, in Council assembled as Bishops in the Church of God, do hereby<br/>solemnly declare to all whom it may concern, and especially to our<br/>fellow-Christians of the different Communions in this land, who, in<br/>their several spheres, have contended for the religion of Christ:</p>
<p>1.  Our earnest desire that the Savior's prayer, "That we all may be<br/>one," may, in its deepest and truest sense, be speedily fulfilled;</p>
<p>2.  That we believe that all who have been duly baptized with water,<br/>in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, are<br/>members of the Holy Catholic Church.</p>
<p>3.  That in all things of human ordering or human choice, relating to<br/>modes of worship and discipline, or to traditional customs, this Church<br/>is ready in the spirit of love and humility to forego all preferences of<br/>her own;</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>4.  That this Church does not seek to absorb other Communions, but<br/>rather, co-operating with them on the basis of a common Faith and Order,<br/>to discountenance schism, to heal the wounds of the Body of Christ, and<br/>to promote the charity which is the chief of Christian graces and the<br/>visibile manifestation of Christ to the world.</p>
<p>But furthermore, we do hereby affirm that the Christian unity...can be<br/>restored only by the return of all Christian communions to the<br/>principles of unity exemplified by the undivided Catholic Church during<br/>the first ages of its existence; which principles we believe to be the<br/>substantial deposit of Christian Faith and Order committed by Christ and<br/>his Apostles to the Church unto the end of the world, and therefore<br/>incapable of compromise or surrender by those who have been ordained to<br/>be its stewards and trustees for the common and equal benefit of all<br/>men.</p>
<p>As inherent parts of this sacred deposit, and therefore as essential to<br/>the restoration of unity among the divided branches of Christendom, we<br/>account the following, to wit:</p>
<p>1.  The Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments as the revealed<br/>Word of God.</p>
<p>2.  The Nicene Creed as the sufficient statement of the Christian Faith.</p>
<p>3.  The two Sacraments,&mdash;Baptism and the Supper of the Lord,&mdash;ministered<br/>with unfailing use of Christ's words of institution and of the elements<br/>ordained by Him.</p>
<p>4.  The Historic Episcopate, locally adapted in the methods of its<br/>administration to the varying needs of the nations and peoples called of<br/>God into the unity of His Church.</p>
<p><i>Furthermore,</i> Deeply grieved by the sad divisions which affect the<br/>Christian Church in oun own land, we hereby declare our desire and<br/>readiness, so soon as there shall be any authorized response to this<br/>Declaration, to enter into brotherly conference with all or any<br/>Christian Bodies seeking the restoration of the organic unity of the<br/>Church, with a view to the earnest study of the conditions under which<br/>so priceless a blessing might happily be brought to pass.</p>
<p><i>Note:  While the above form of the Quadrilateral was adopted by the<br/>House of Bishops, it was not enacted by the House of Deputies, but<br/>rather incorporated in a general plan referred for study and action to a<br/>newly created Joint Commission on Christian Reunion.</i></p>
<p><i>Lambeth Conferent of 1888<br/>Resolution 11</i></p>
<p>That, in the opinion of this Conference, the following Articles supply a<br/>basis on which approach may be by God's blessing made towards Home<br/>Reunion:</p>
<p>(a) The Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, as "containing<br/>all things necessary to salvation," and as being the rule and ultimate<br/>standard of faith.</p>
<p>(b) The Apostles' Creed, as the Baptismal Symbol; and the Nicene Creed,<br/>as the sufficient statement of the Christian faith.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<h1>Tables and Rules for Finding the Date of Easter Day</h1>
<h1>Rules for Finding the Date of Easter Day</h1>
<p>Easter Day is always the Sunday after the full moon that occurs on or<br/>after the spring equinox on March 21, a date which is fixed in accordance<br/>with an ancient ecclesiastical computation, and which does not always<br/>correspond to the astronomical equinox.  This full moon may happen on<br/>any date between March 21 and April 18 inclusive.  If the full moon<br/>falls on a Sunday, Easter Day is the Sunday following.  But Easter Day<br/>cannot be earlier than March 22 or later than April 25.</p>
<p>To find the date of Easter Day in any particular year, it is necessary<br/>to have two points of reference&mdash;the Golden Number and the Sunday Letter<br/>for that year.</p>
<p>1.  The Golden Number indicates the date of the full moon on or after<br/>the spring equinox of March 21, according to a nineteen-year cycle.<br/>These Numbers are prefixed in the Calendar to the days of the month from<br/>March 22 to April 19 inclusive.  In the present Calendar they are<br/>applicable from A.D. 1900 to A.D. 2099, after which they will change.</p>
<p>2.  The Sunday Letter identifies the days of the year when Sundays<br/>occur.  After every date in the Calendar a letter appears&mdash;from [A] to<br/>[g].  Thus, if January 1 is a Sunday, the Sunday Letter for the Year is<br/>[A], and every date in the Calendar marked by [A] is a Sunday.  If<br/>January 2 is a Sunday, then every date marked with [b] is a Sunday, and<br/>so on through the seven letters.</p>
<p>In Leap Years, however, the Sunday Letter changes on the first day of<br/>March.  In such years, when [A] is the Sunday Letter, this applies only<br/>to Sundays in January and February, and [g] is the Sunday Letter for the<br/>rest of the year.  Or if [d] is the Sunday Letter, then [c] is the<br/>Sunday Letter on and after March 1.</p>
<h1>To Find the Golden Number</h1>
<p>The Golden Number of any year is calculated as follows:  Take the number<br/>of the year, add 1, and then divide the sum by 19.  The remainder, if<br/>any, is the Golden Number.  If nothing remains, then 19 is the Golden<br/>Number.</p>
<h1>To Find the Sunday Letter</h1>
<p>The following Table provides ready reference to the Sunday Letter of any<br/>year between  A.D. 1900 and  A.D. 2099.  It will be found on the line of<br/>the hundredth year above the column that contains the remaining digits<br/>of the year.  But in Leap Years the Letter above the number marked with<br/>an asterisk is the Sunday Letter for January and February, and the<br/>Letter over the number not so marked is the Sunday Letter for the rest<br/>of the year.</p>]]>

<h1>To Find Easter Day</h1>
<p>When one has both tho Golden Number and the Sunday Letter for any<br/>particular year, then the date of Easter Day may be found in the<br/>Calendar, pages 21 and 22, as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The Golden Number prefixed to a day in the month of March or April<br/>in the Calendar marks the date of the full moon in that year.</p>
<p>2.  Easter Day will be the next date bearing the Sunday Letter of that<br/>year.  But when the Golden Number of a given year and the Sunday Letter<br/>of that year occur on the same date, then Easter day is one week later.<br/>(For example, if the Golden Number is 19&mdash;which appears in the Calendar<br/>prefixed to March 27&mdash;and the Sunday Letter is [d], then Easter Day in<br/>that year will fall on March 29.  If the Golden Number is 10 and the<br/>Sunday Letter is [A], then Easter Day will fall on April 9.  But if the<br/>Golden Number is 19 and the Sunday Letter is [b], then Easter Day will<br/>be one week later, namely April 3.)</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p><i>Concerning the Lectionary</i></p>
<p><i>The Lectionary for Sundays is arranged in a three-year cycle, in which<br/>Year A always begins on the First Sunday of Advent in years evenly<br/>divisible by three.  (For example, 1977 divided by 3 is 659 with no<br/>remainder.  Year A, therefore, begins on Advent Sunday of that year.)</i></p>
<p><i>The Psalms and Lessons appointed for the Sundays and for other major<br/>Holy Days are intended for use at all public services on such days,<br/>except when the same congregation attends two or more services.  Thus,<br/>the same Lessons are to be read at the principal morning service,<br/>whether the Liturgy of the Word takes the form given in the Holy<br/>Eucharist, or that of the Daily Office.</i></p>
<p><i>When the same congregation is present for Morning or Evening Prayer, in<br/>addition to the Eucharist, the Lessons at the Office may be selected<br/>from one of the other years of the three-year Sunday cycle, or from the<br/>Lectionary for the Daily Office.  The Psalms at such Offices are<br/>normally those appointed in the Office Lectionary; but, when desired,<br/>the Psalm cited in the selected Sunday Proper may be used instead.</i></p>
<p><i>In this Lectionary, the selections from the Psalter are frequently<br/>cited in a longer and shorter version, usually from the same Psalm.  The<br/>longer version is particularly appropriate for use at the Office, the<br/>shorter version when the Psalm is sung between the Lessons at the<br/>Eucharist.  The selections may be further lengthened or shortened at<br/>discretion.</i></p>
<p><i>When an alternative Lesson is cited, it is sometimes identical with a<br/>Lesson appointed for the same day in the Daily Office Lectionary.</i></p>
<p><i>In the opening verses of Lessons, the Reader should omit initial<br/>conjunctions which refer only to what has preceded, substitute nouns for<br/>pronouns when the referent is not otherwise clear, or else prefix to the<br/>Reading some such introduction as, "<b><span class="person">N</span></b> said (to <b><span class="person">N</span></b>)."</i></p>
<p><i>Any Reading may be lengthened at discretion.  Suggested lengthenings<br/>are shown in parentheses.</i></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p><i>Concerning the Daily Office Lectionary</i></p>
<p><i>The Daily Office Lectionary is arranged in a two-year cycle. Year One<br/>begins on the First Sunday of Advent preceding odd-numbered years, and<br/>Year Two begins on the First Sunday of Advent preceding even-numbered<br/>years.  (Thus, on the First Sunday of Advent, 1976, the Lectionary for<br/>Year One is begun.)</i></p>
<p><i>Three Readings are provided for each Sunday and weekday in each of the<br/>two years.  Two of the Readings may be used in the morning and one in<br/>the evening; or, if the Office is read only once in the day, all three<br/>Readings may be used.  When the Office is read twice in the day, it is<br/>suggested that the Gospel Reading be used in the evening in Year One,<br/>and in the morning in Year Two.  If two Readings are desired at both<br/>Offices, the Old Testament Reading for the alternate year is used as the<br/>First Reading at Evening Prayer.</i></p>
<p><i>When more than one Reading is used at an Office, the first is always<br/>from the Old Testament (or the Apocrypha).</i></p>
<p><i>When a Major Feast interrupts the sequence of Readings, they may be re-<br/>ordered by lengthening, combining, or omitting some of them, to secure<br/>continuity or avoid repitition.</i></p>
<p><i>Any Reading may be lengthened at discretion.  Suggested lengthenings<br/>are shown in parentheses.</i></p>
<p><i>In this Lectionary (except in the weeks from 4 Advent to 1 Epiphany,<br/>and Palm Sunday to 2 Easter), the Psalms are arranged in a seven-week<br/>pattern which recurs throughout the year, except for appropriate<br/>variations in Lent and Easter Season.</i></p>
<p><i>In the citation of the Psalms, those for the morning are given first,<br/>and then those for the evening.  At the discretion of the officiant,<br/>however, any of the Psalms appointed for a given day may be used in the<br/>morning or in the evening.  Likewise, Psalms appointed for any day may<br/>be used on any other day in the same week, except on major Holy Days.</i></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p><i>Brackets and parentheses are used (brackets in the case of whole<br/>Psalms, parentheses in the case of verses) to indicate Psalms and verses<br/>of Psalms which may be omitted.  In some instances, the entire portion<br/>of the Psalter assigned to a given Office has been bracketed, and<br/>alternative Psalmody provided.  Those who desire to recite the Psalter<br/>in its entirety should, in each instance, use the bracketed Psalms<br/>rather than the alternatives.</i></p>
<p><i>Antiphons drawn from the Psalms themselves, or from the opening<br/>sentences given in the Offices, or from other passages of Scripture, may<br/>be used with the Psalms and biblical Canticles.  The antiphons may be<br/>sung or said at the beginning and end of each Psalm or Canticle, or may<br/>be used as refrains after each verse or group of verses.</i></p>
<p><i>On Special Occasions, the officiant may select suitable Psalms and<br/>Readings.</i></p>]]>
